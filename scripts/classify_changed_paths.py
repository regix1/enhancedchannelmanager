"""Classify a changed-file set for the CI gates that read it.

Origin: bead enhancedchannelmanager-5rwzy. Extended for the published
user-guide site in bead enhancedchannelmanager-t4d5w.

Two independent verdicts come out of one changed-file set:

    code_paths_changed   at least one changed path is an input to a code gate
    docs_site_affected   something the mkdocs user-guide site is built from
                         changed, so the site needs rebuilding and republishing

## Why this exists

`dev` branch protection requires eight status checks; `main` requires a
narrower four (`Backend Tests`, `Frontend Tests`, and the two
`CodeQL Analysis` contexts). Before this script, two workflows could emit
the same required check name on one commit:
`test.yml` ran on `paths-ignore: ['**.md', '.beads/**']` and
`docs-only-pass.yml` ran on `paths: ['**.md', '.beads/**']`. Those filters are
not complements. A pull request that touches BOTH code and Markdown matches
both, so every required context existed twice: once real, once a permanently
green `echo`. Observed live on PR #797, where `Backend Tests` reported
`failure` and `success` on the same commit.

The fix is one source of truth per context. Every job that emits a required
check now runs on every pull request, so the context exists exactly once, and
gates its expensive steps on the output of this classifier. Only an explicitly
inert machine-state change can take the cheap no-op path.

## The code_paths_changed rule

The verdict is false only when EVERY changed path is an approved root
machine-generated beads state file. Every other path is code-gate input,
regardless of suffix, case, location, or intended use. Anything absent,
unknown, or ambiguous is treated as code.

## The docs_site_affected rule

The published user-guide site is built from a much narrower slice of the tree
than `docs/`: `mkdocs.yml` excludes every internal directory. A change is
site-affecting when ANY changed path is one the site build reads:

    docs/user_guide/**                any published page
    docs/images/user_guide/**         any published screenshot
    docs/index.md                     the site landing page
    mkdocs.yml                        the site definition itself
    docs/requirements-docs.txt        the pinned build toolchain
    .github/workflows/docs-pages.yml  the build-and-deploy workflow

That list used to live in the `paths:` filter of `docs-pages.yml`. It lives
here now, and that workflow reads this output, so there is one definition.

## Fail-open, never fail-closed

The two verdicts fail open in OPPOSITE directions, because their dangerous
answers are opposite.

For `code_paths_changed`, misclassifying code as inert turns a required check
green without running the work it is named for; misclassifying documentation
as code only costs runner minutes. So every ambiguous input (empty file list,
unreadable input) resolves to `code_paths_changed=true`, and callers gate work on
`code_paths_changed != 'false'` so an absent or empty output still runs the real work.

For `docs_site_affected`, the dangerous answer is a `false` that skips a site
rebuild and leaves the published site stale behind the merged content. So
ambiguous input resolves to `docs_site_affected=true`, and `docs-pages.yml`
gates on `!= 'false'` so an absent or empty output still builds.

Either way the script exits 0 unconditionally: a classifier hiccup must never
be able to skip a dependent job by dying.

## Usage

    python scripts/classify_changed_paths.py --files-from changed_files.json
    git diff --name-only --no-renames -z origin/dev...HEAD | \
        python scripts/classify_changed_paths.py --input-format nul

Writes two `key=value` lines to stdout in the form GitHub Actions
`$GITHUB_OUTPUT` consumes:

    code_paths_changed=true|false
    docs_site_affected=true|false

Consumers must read the key they care about by name, not by line position.
Diagnostics go to stderr so stdout stays machine-parseable.
