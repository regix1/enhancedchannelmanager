"""Render a one-line run summary for a required CI check.

Origin: bead enhancedchannelmanager-t4d5w.

## Why this exists

Six of the eight required status checks on `dev` gate their real work on the
documentation-only classifier. That is correct, but the check NAME is the same
either way: `Backend Tests` reads as "the backend tests ran" whether pytest
executed 2000 tests or the job printed a sentence and exited. A reader of the
checks rollup, human or agent, cannot tell the two apart without opening the
job log.

So every required job writes one line to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` saying what it
actually did. For the three jobs that produce a JUnit report, this script turns
that report into a test count, so the line carries evidence rather than a
claim. It changes no conclusion and gates nothing.

## The summary must not repeat the lie it exists to expose

Callers run this under `if: always()` so the line appears on a failed run too,
which is exactly when knowing the count matters. But `always()` also fires
when the suite never ran at all, because an earlier step in the same job
failed first. Printing "ran the backend pytest suite" there would be the same
class of untruth this whole change exists to close, one layer down.

So `--outcome` takes the GitHub `steps.<id>.outcome` of the step that does the
work. An empty value means the step never executed, and the line says so. The
flag defaults to empty, which understates rather than overstates: a caller
that forgets it gets "did NOT run", never a false claim that it did.

## Never fails the job

A summary writer that can fail turns a passing suite into a red check for a
cosmetic reason. Every error path in `read_counts` degrades to a line saying
the count was unavailable, and `main` returns 0 on every path it reaches.
Argparse is the one exception: a malformed invocation exits 2 before `main`
runs. That is a wiring bug, not a runtime condition, and callers pass
`continue-on-error: true` so even that cannot redden a required check.

## Usage

    python scripts/ci_junit_summary.py \
        --label "Backend Tests" \
        --ran "ran the backend pytest suite" \
        --junit backend/junit.xml \
        --outcome "${{ steps.pytest.outcome }}"
