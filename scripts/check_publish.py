"""Confirm that a merge to `dev` actually reached the container registry.

This is a POST-MERGE check (bead enhancedchannelmanager-t8fqg). It is not
a CI gate and must never become one: a check that runs after the merge
cannot gate the merge it follows, and wiring it into the PR flow would
add a permanently-failing context to every open PR.

## Why it exists

The published `:dev` tag has silently lagged the `dev` branch four times,
from four unrelated causes:

  1. A Buildx flake that skipped the multi-arch manifest.
  2. A GitHub Actions outage that orphaned queued runs.
  3. A frontend test flake that correctly gated the publish.
  4. PR #793 (2026-08-07): the `dev` Tests workflow failed on one
     order-dependent frontend flake, so the publish gate correctly
     refused to ship from a failed suite.

Every one of those was the gate behaving correctly. The defect is that
nothing surfaced the resulting drift. On the most recent occurrence `dev`
carried the fix and the registry did not, for about five hours, until an
unrelated merge republished it by accident.

## What it checks

  1. The "Publish Verified Images" workflow run for the commit under
     test concluded `success`.
  2. The published tag's build marker (`ECM_VERSION`, baked into the
     image by the Dockerfile from the `ECM_VERSION` build-arg) equals the
     version in `frontend/package.json` AT THAT COMMIT.

Both must hold. A green workflow with a stale marker means the push
silently did not land on the tag; a correct marker with a failed workflow
means the tag is carrying an older successful build.

The image is read through the registry's config blob
(`docker buildx imagetools inspect`), which does not download layers.
Pass `--pull` for the heavier form used by the restore drill's image
gate: remove the local tag, pull it fresh, and read the marker out of the
pulled image. See `docs/shipping.md` section 6, "Confirm the image
published" ("prove the image before you trust it"), for that idiom and
for where this script sits in the flow.

## Refs it needs

`--commit` defaults to HEAD, and HEAD is the right default precisely
because this runs after `git checkout dev && git pull`: the local branch
IS the merged state, so the check never requires a remote-tracking ref to
do its job. `origin/dev` is only consulted as the preferred (not
required) input to the "is this commit already on dev?" orientation note,
which degrades to "unknown" rather than failing. Passing an `origin/*`
ref explicitly in a checkout that has none reports what to fetch instead
of surfacing git's raw `ambiguous argument` error.

## Usage

    # Normal use: after `gh pr merge`, `git checkout dev && git pull`
    python scripts/check_publish.py

    # A specific commit
    python scripts/check_publish.py --commit <sha>

    # Heavier image gate, matching the restore drill
    python scripts/check_publish.py --pull

Exits 0 when the registry matches `dev`, 1 when it does not or when a
check could not be completed.
