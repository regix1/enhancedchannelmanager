WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
-----------------------------------------
This is a **source-manifest** SBOM. It is derived from the dependency manifests
in the repository -- ``backend/requirements.txt``, ``frontend/package-lock.json``,
``mcp-server/requirements.txt`` -- and from the digest-pinned base images named
in the two Dockerfiles. It is **not** an image SBOM: it does not enumerate the
Debian or Alpine packages inside those base images, and it does not name the
published subject image digest, because at release-cut time no release image
exists yet. Digest-pinned base and build image references are recorded.

That limitation is deliberate and load-bearing, so it is stated in the document
itself (``creationInfo.comment``) as well as here. An SBOM whose coverage is
misunderstood is worse than no SBOM, because it will be believed.

WHY NOT AN IMAGE SBOM (bead enhancedchannelmanager-3t0ht)
---------------------------------------------------------
An image SBOM has to be generated from an image, and the images a release
publishes are built *after* the release branch is frozen: ``build.yml`` runs on
the push to ``main`` that the release PR's merge commit creates. That merge
commit has a different SHA from the release branch tip, and ``Dockerfile`` bakes
``GIT_COMMIT`` into the ECM image as an ``ENV``, so the image built from the
release branch and the image published from ``main`` are guaranteed to have
different digests even though their contents are otherwise identical. Building
on ``release/**`` and inventorying *that* image would therefore commit a
document naming a digest that is not, and never will be, in the registry.

TWO KINDS OF DIRECTORY, SEPARATED BY PATH RATHER THAN BY CONVENTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------
``sbom/vX.Y.Z/`` is a **release record**. Release records accumulate and are kept
forever: when an advisory lands the question is *which shipped versions contain
the affected package*, and that is only answerable if the history is there.

``sbom/dev/`` is a **transient snapshot** of whatever ``dev`` currently carries.
There is at most one, and it is superseded rather than accumulated. It is not an
artifact of record and no released version is described by it.

The two are told apart by the **shape of the version string**, which decides the
path, so they cannot be confused and cannot occupy each other's namespace.
``docs/versioning.md`` §Format: a release drops the ``-BUILD`` suffix, so
``X.Y.Z`` is a release and ``X.Y.Z-NNNN`` is a dev build. ``channel_for`` is the
single place that judgement is made and ``directory_for`` is the single place a
path is derived from it, so ``generate --version 0.18.1-0147`` cannot create a
release directory no matter who types it.

This mattered: ``sbom/v0.18.1-0144/`` was committed for a build number that was
never released, and its contents became wrong when a 60-package dependency sweep
landed one build later. A directory holding an inventory matching nothing that
ever shipped is worse than no directory, because it is the first thing somebody
finds when they go looking during an incident.

BINDING
-------
Because there is no published subject image digest to bind to, this document
binds to what it can actually be checked against: the exact bytes of every
manifest it was derived from. ``sbom/vX.Y.Z/index.json`` records the SHA-256 of
each source manifest, and ``verify`` regenerates the documents from the working
tree and byte-compares them. Editing a requirement without regenerating,
hand-editing a document, or committing a document for the wrong version all fail
the check. The only field carried over from the committed document rather than
recomputed is ``creationInfo.created``, which is a timestamp and cannot be
re-derived; every other byte is re-derived from the tree.
