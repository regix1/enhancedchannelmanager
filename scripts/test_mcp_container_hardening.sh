#
# End-to-end isolation gate for the ECM MCP sidecar
# (enhancedchannelmanager-04c0u.8).
#
# This brings up the SHIPPED topology — `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml
# -f docker-compose.mcp.yml` — on brand-new, unprovisioned Docker volumes, with
# no manual privilege or ownership step, and drives the whole credential path:
#
#     ECM writes the projection  ->  the sidecar reads it  ->  a client
#     authenticates with it  ->  ECM rotates it  ->  the superseded key dies.
#
# The producer is deliberately the real one. An earlier revision of this script
# hand-seeded the projection from `docker run --user 0:0` and then chowned the
# files to the target uid. That substituted root for the actor whose writability
# is actually in question — the ECM backend at PUID, writing into a directory
# Docker created as root:root 0755 — so every downstream assertion was true of a
# hand-seeded container and said nothing about the shipped deployment. It passed
# green while a first-run `docker compose up` could not start ECM at all.
#
# What is asserted, all against live containers:
#
#   * ECM starts on unprovisioned volumes and reaches /api/health/ready,
#   * ECM — not this script — writes both projection files, owner-only and
#     owned by PUID/PGID,
#   * the sidecar runs as that same fixed non-root uid,
#   * the sidecar can read its projection and nothing else: no ECM settings,
#     auth data, journal, TLS keys or backups exist for it to open,
#   * a different uid inside the sidecar cannot read the projection,
#   * the sidecar's root filesystem is read-only, all capabilities are dropped,
#     no-new-privileges is set, and /tmp is a bounded noexec/nosuid/nodev tmpfs,
#   * an authenticated MCP session lists tools through all of that,
#   * rotating the key through ECM takes effect without a restart, with the
#     superseded key rejected, and
#   * a BROKEN projection degrades rather than 5xx-ing authenticated routes,
#     logs once rather than once per request, and repairs itself without a
#     restart once the fault is cleared.
#
# Usage: scripts/test_mcp_container_hardening.sh
#
# Environment:
#   PUID / PGID   runtime identity to test (default 1000/1000). The invariant is
#                 "any pair the compose file accepts", so CI runs this twice.
#   ECM_PORT, ECM_HTTPS_PORT, MCP_PORT
#                 published ports; free ports are chosen automatically when unset
#                 so a developer's own ECM stack is never disturbed.
#   COMPOSE_BUILD if "false", require the images to exist already.
#   MCP_GATE_PROJECT
#                 compose project name (default "ecmmcpgate").
