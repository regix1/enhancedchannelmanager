# Enhanced Channel Manager

A professional-grade web interface for managing IPTV configurations with [Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr). Built with React + TypeScript and Python FastAPI.

ECM gives you full control over your IPTV setup: manage M3U accounts and EPG sources, create and organize channels with drag-and-drop, automate channel creation with a powerful rules engine, probe stream health, and monitor live streaming stats — all from a single interface.

## Installation

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

```yaml
services:
  ecm:
    image: ghcr.io/motwakorb/enhancedchannelmanager:latest
    ports:
      - "6100:6100"   # HTTP (configurable via ECM_PORT)
      - "6143:6143"   # HTTPS (configurable via ECM_HTTPS_PORT)
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - ECM_PORT=6100
      - ECM_HTTPS_PORT=6143
    # The image ships a HEALTHCHECK with `start_period=120s` baked in
    # (bd-ul0ah). On long-running installs the first-run migrations can
    # run against a bloated SQLite WAL file and take >30s — Docker's
    # default start_period would mark the container unhealthy before
    # migrations finish. If you need to override, set the healthcheck
    # block here; operators on consistently fast installs can lower it.
```

That's it. Open `http://localhost:6100` and the setup wizard will guide you through creating an admin account and connecting to Dispatcharr.

### With MCP Server (Claude AI Integration)

To add the optional MCP server for managing ECM through Claude, add the MCP service to your compose file:

```yaml
services:
  ecm:
    image: ghcr.io/motwakorb/enhancedchannelmanager:latest
    ports:
      - "6100:6100"
      - "6143:6143"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      # ECM writes MCP credential material here. This is the ONLY ECM-owned
      # directory the AI-facing sidecar can see.
      - ecm-mcp-secrets:/run/secrets/ecm-mcp
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - MCP_SECRETS_DIR=/run/secrets/ecm-mcp

  ecm-mcp:
    image: ghcr.io/motwakorb/enhancedchannelmanager-mcp:latest
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:6101:6101"
    volumes:
      # Credential projection only. Do NOT mount /config here: the sidecar is
      # the process most exposed to prompt injection, and a /config mount puts
      # settings.json, auth_settings.json, the audit journal, TLS private keys
      # and every stored backup one file read away from it.
      - ecm-mcp-secrets:/run/secrets/ecm-mcp:ro
    # Must match ECM's PUID/PGID above: the projection is owner-only (0600) and
    # the sidecar can read it only because it runs as the same account.
    user: "1000:1000"
    read_only: true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=16m,mode=1777
    pids_limit: 128
    mem_limit: 256m
    cpus: 1.0
    environment:
      - MCP_SECRETS_DIR=/run/secrets/ecm-mcp
      - ECM_URL=http://ecm:6100
      - MCP_PORT=6101
      # Container-internal bind; host publishing above remains loopback-only.
      - MCP_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
    depends_on:
      ecm:
        condition: service_healthy

volumes:
  ecm-mcp-secrets:
```

**Upgrading from an MCP sidecar that mounted `./config:/config:ro`.** Add the
`ecm-mcp-secrets` volume and the `MCP_SECRETS_DIR` variable to *both* services
as shown, then recreate. Recreating the containers alone is not enough. The
sidecar images from v0.18.1 onward default `MCP_SECRETS_DIR` to
`/run/secrets/ecm-mcp`, so without that volume the sidecar finds an empty
directory and reports `api_key_status: file_not_found` permanently. Once the
volume is in place, ECM publishes an existing key during startup or provisions
one when upgrading settings that predate the field; no save or regeneration is
needed to make the sidecar ready. An explicitly revoked key stays revoked.

Or if you're building from source, use the MCP compose overlay:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mcp.yml up -d
```

This default publishes MCP on host loopback only. For another machine, put an
HTTPS reverse proxy in front of MCP and use the fail-closed remote overlay:

```bash
MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS=mcp.example.home \
MCP_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS=172.20.0.10 \
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mcp.yml \
  -f docker-compose.mcp.remote.yml up -d
```

The proxy must terminate TLS and forward to port 6101. Do not expose port 6101
through a router or firewall; remote mode rejects non-HTTPS `/mcp` requests.
**ECM's own TLS setting does not protect MCP.** It terminates HTTPS for ECM's
web interface on port 6143 only. The MCP sidecar is a separate listener with no
TLS of its own, so the reverse proxy is what encrypts MCP traffic.
`MCP_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` accepts only explicit IP addresses or bounded CIDRs.
Trust-all values (`*`, `0.0.0.0/0`, and `::/0`) and malformed entries stop the
sidecar at startup. Forwarded HTTPS is honored only from a configured peer.

**Reaching the MCP container from ECM** — ECM's Settings > MCP Integration status badge probes the MCP server's `/health` endpoint. By default it targets `ecm-mcp:6101`, which Docker DNS resolves to the MCP container on the canonical compose network — no extra configuration needed. If you run both containers with `network_mode: host` (host network namespace shared), set `MCP_HOST=localhost` on the ECM service so the probe targets the host loopback instead of the (non-existent on that topology) `ecm-mcp` DNS name.

**Allowed MCP hostnames:** The MCP sidecar accepts `localhost`, loopback IPs,
and the Compose service name `ecm-mcp` by default. The remote HTTPS profile
requires the proxy-facing hostname in `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma-separated for
more than one), then recreates the container.
List hostnames/IPs only: no scheme, port, path, or wildcard. Requests carrying
any other or malformed `Host` value are rejected before MCP routing.

**Reaching ECM from the MCP container** — the symmetric case. The MCP server calls ECM's backend API at its `ECM_URL` (default `http://ecm:6100`, Docker DNS on the canonical compose network). If both containers run with `network_mode: host`, the `ecm` service name has no DNS entry on the shared host network and the backend answers only on the host loopback, so every MCP tool call fails with `All connection attempts failed`. Fix: set `ECM_URL=http://localhost:6100` on the MCP service. See [MCP integration troubleshooting](docs/user_guide/integrations/mcp.md#mcp-tools-fail-with-all-connection-attempts-failed).

> **Upgrade note (v0.17.1-0066+):** If you previously ran ECM and ecm-mcp with `network_mode: host` and never set `MCP_HOST`, you need to act. Earlier versions hardcoded `localhost` as the probe target; v0.17.1-0064 changed the default to `ecm-mcp` (the canonical compose service name). On a host-networking deploy, `ecm-mcp` does not resolve — so after pulling `dev`, your Settings > MCP Integration badge will show "MCP server not reachable" even when MCP is healthy. Fix: add `MCP_HOST=localhost` to the ECM service's `environment` block in your compose file and restart the container.

See [MCP Server (Claude Integration)](#mcp-server-claude-integration) for setup instructions.

**User / Group Identifiers:**
- **PUID** (default: 1000) — User ID the application runs as
- **PGID** (default: 1000) — Group ID the application runs as

Set these to match the owner of your bind-mounted volumes to avoid permission issues. Find your IDs with `id your_user`.

**Port Configuration:**
- **ECM_PORT** (default: 6100): HTTP interface. It remains available when TLS is enabled, but ECM refuses to start or refresh a browser session there (see below).
- **ECM_HTTPS_PORT** (default: 6143) — HTTPS interface (when TLS is configured in Settings)

When ECM TLS is enabled, use the HTTPS address for the web UI. The HTTP port
continues to serve health checks and unauthenticated recovery surfaces, but sign-in,
Dispatcharr sign-in and token refresh all answer `403` there with a message naming the
HTTPS address, rather than appearing to succeed and then failing on the next request.
Session cookies are `Secure`, `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Lax`.

**Turning TLS on signs everyone out once.** The moment ECM starts terminating TLS, every
existing browser session is revoked, so a browser still holding a pre-activation cookie
cannot keep replaying it. Everyone, including the administrator who made the change,
signs in again over HTTPS. That moment is wherever it actually happens: switching TLS on
when a certificate is already present, issuing or completing a Let's Encrypt
certificate, uploading one manually, or a manual renewal that issues the first
certificate. Switching TLS on *before* any certificate exists is not activation and
signs nobody out, because you still need the UI to finish issuing.

Reverse proxy deployments should set the canonical `public_base_url` to an `https://`
origin. ECM's own policy code does not consult `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`
or `Forwarded`, because it has no trusted-proxy allowlist of its own. That setting
is how a proxy declares its external scheme. (Note that uvicorn, the server ECM runs under,
enables its own `ProxyHeadersMiddleware` by default and may rewrite the request scheme
for clients within `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`, which defaults to `127.0.0.1`. That is
uvicorn's policy, not ECM's.)

#### Emergency recovery when HTTPS is unreachable

There are two escape hatches. Both send session credentials in plaintext, so use them
only on a trusted network and close them the moment HTTPS is repaired. Both work
regardless of whether `public_base_url` is set.

1. **If you can still sign in over HTTPS**, enable **Emergency recovery: allow
   authenticated sessions over HTTP** in Settings › TLS. While it is actually costing you
   protection (ECM's own TLS is on, or `public_base_url` is an `https://` origin), the
   TLS panel shows a plaintext-session warning banner and ECM logs a warning. On a
   plain-HTTP install with neither, the hatch changes nothing and both stay quiet.
2. **If you cannot sign in at all**, stop ECM, set
   `ECM_ALLOW_HTTP_SESSION_COOKIES=true` on the ECM container, and restart it. ECM logs
   a warning at startup for as long as it is set. Sign in through HTTP only long enough
   to repair or disable TLS, then remove the variable (or set it back to `false`) and
   restart ECM.

Values other than `1`, `true`, `yes` or `on` (including the `false` that
`docker-compose.yml` ships by default) leave the protection ON.

**Your browser may refuse to open the HTTP port at all. Read this before you need it.**
Every HTTPS response from ECM carries `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`
(one year, deliberately without `includeSubDomains` and without `preload`). Per
[RFC 6797 §8.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6797#section-8.3) that pin is scoped
to the **hostname and is port-agnostic**: once you have visited
`https://ecm.example.com:6143` even once, your browser will silently upgrade
`http://ecm.example.com:6100` to `https://ecm.example.com:6100` for a year, with no
click-through to bypass it. So "browse to `http://ecm.example.com:6100`" is *not* a
recovery instruction that works on a pinned browser. Use one of these instead:

- **Reach ECM by IP literal**, e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:6100`. HSTS pins are stored
  per hostname and are never applied to IP addresses, so this always works and is the
  fastest route.
- **Use a different hostname** for the same instance (another DNS name, or a
  `hosts`-file alias) that you have never visited over HTTPS.
- **Clear the pin** for the hostname: in Chrome/Edge open `chrome://net-internals/#hsts`,
  enter the domain under *Delete domain security policies*, and delete it. In Firefox,
  open the History sidebar (or Library › History), right-click the site and choose
  *Forget About This Site*. Note that this also clears that site's cookies, cache and
  history. Then browse to the HTTP port.

**Volumes:**
- `/config` — Persistent storage for database, settings, logos, TLS certificates, and backups

### Backup & Restore

ECM supports full backup and restore of all configuration. You can create backups from Settings, or restore from a backup during the first-run setup wizard.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# Backend
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Features

### Channel Management
Full CRUD for channels and groups with a split-pane layout. Drag-and-drop streams onto channels, reorder streams by priority, bulk-create channels from stream groups with smart name normalization (quality variants, country prefixes, timezone handling), and organize everything into numbered channel groups. Staged edit mode lets you queue changes locally and commit or discard them as a batch.

### M3U Manager
Manage Standard M3U, XtreamCodes, and HD Homerun accounts. Link related accounts so group enable/disable changes cascade automatically. Track changes detected across M3U refreshes with filtering, search, and optional email digest notifications.

### EPG Manager
Configure multiple XMLTV and Schedules Direct EPG sources with drag-and-drop priority ordering. Create dummy EPG entries for channels without guide data. Bulk EPG assignment uses country-aware matching, call sign scoring, and HD preference to automatically map EPG data to channels.

### TV Guide
EPG grid view with now-playing highlights, date/time navigation, channel profile filtering, and click-to-edit channel metadata.

### Channel Pipeline
A rules-based automation engine for channel creation, stream merging, and lifecycle management. Build complex conditions (stream name, group, quality, codec, normalized matching, etc.) with AND/OR logic, then define actions (create channel/group, merge streams, assign metadata, set variables, name transforms). Per-rule normalization group selection lets each rule apply specific normalization groups. Supports dry-run preview, execution rollback, YAML import/export, orphan reconciliation, and a diagnostic debug bundle for troubleshooting.

### Stream Health & Probing
Automated stream probing with configurable schedules, batch sizes, retry logic, and rate limit detection. Profile-aware probing distributes connections across M3U profiles. Results drive smart stream sorting by resolution, bitrate, framerate, video codec, and M3U priority with configurable ordering for deprioritized stream categories. Black screen detection identifies streams showing dark/blank content, and low FPS detection flags streams below a configurable threshold (5/10/15/20 FPS). Both are deprioritized in Smart Sort. A strikeout system tracks consecutive failures for bulk cleanup.

### Logo Manager
Browse, search, upload, and assign logos to channels. Supports URL import and file upload to Dispatcharr with usage tracking and pagination.

### Stats & Monitoring
Live dashboard showing active channels, M3U connection counts, per-channel FFmpeg metrics (speed, FPS, bitrate), and bandwidth charts. Enhanced analytics include unique viewer tracking with Dispatcharr user identification, per-channel bandwidth, popularity scoring with trend analysis, and watch history with user attribution.

### Journal
Activity log tracking all changes to channels, EPG, and M3U accounts with filtering by category, action type, and time range. A daily Journal Noise Purge task auto-deletes automated-noise entries (watch start/stop telemetry and automated Channel Pipeline rule create/delete churn) older than a configurable retention window (default 3 days); operator-initiated entries and all other categories are kept.

### Settings
Comprehensive configuration including Dispatcharr connection, channel defaults, stream name normalization (tag-based and rule-based engines), stream probing, scheduled tasks (EPG/M3U refresh, probing, cleanup), alert methods (Discord, Telegram, email), authentication (local + Dispatcharr SSO), user management, TLS certificates, VLC integration, appearance themes, and backup/restore.

### Authentication
First-run setup wizard, local auth with bcrypt hashing, Dispatcharr SSO, account linking, email-based password reset, and CLI password reset for lockout recovery. JWT-based sessions with automatic token refresh.

### Notification Center
In-app notification bell with history, active task pinning, and external alert methods (Discord webhooks, Telegram bots, SMTP email) with digest batching and source filtering.

## MCP Server (Claude Integration)

ECM includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server: an optional sidecar container that exposes ECM's functionality to Claude — **Claude Desktop**, **Claude Code**, or any MCP-capable client — so you can manage your install in plain language instead of clicking through the UI. **130 tools across 14 domains** (channels, channel groups, streams, M3U accounts, EPG sources, channel pipeline, scheduled tasks, stats, system/backup, notifications, profiles, normalization, deduplication, Emby integration), plus an `overview` resource that gives Claude a one-shot snapshot of your install.

Everything Claude does runs against your live ECM through the API — it's the same operations the UI performs, just driven by conversation. Mutating actions report the resulting state back (e.g. the new channel's group and number) so you can confirm the change took effect.

### What you can do with it

Things you can ask Claude to do:

**Channels & streams**
- "List every channel in the Sports group that has fewer than 2 streams"
- "Find duplicate channels and merge each set, keeping the one with the most streams"
- "Add these 8 streams to channel 412 and put the 1080p ones first"
- "Renumber the News group starting at 200"
- "Build a channel lineup from this list of names and fuzzy-match streams to each"

**Channel Pipeline**
- "Run the Channel Pipeline and tell me what it created"
- "Analyze my Channel Pipeline rules and flag anything misconfigured" — the Rule Analyzer catches regex/structural mistakes (`UK|` that matches everything, `^4K` typed under *Contains* that matches nothing, double-escape typos, OR-arms missing a group guard, merges into empty groups) without running the rule
- "Create a rule that auto-creates channels for any stream whose name contains 'PPV', into the Events group"
- "Why didn't the 4K Sports rule match anything?" — Claude can pull a debug bundle and analyze it
- "Clear all the channels that the Channel Pipeline made in the Test group"

**M3U & EPG**
- "Refresh all my M3U accounts and report any failures"
- "Which channels are missing an EPG ID?" → "assign tvg_ids to those"
- "Probe every stream in the Movies group and list the dead ones"

**Housekeeping & insight**
- "Show me this week's watch stats" / "which channels has nobody watched in 30 days?"
- "What scheduled tasks are enabled?" / "run the cleanup task"
- "Back up my config" / "give me an overview of this ECM install"

### Setup

> **Dispatcharr fields in `settings.json` (GH #273)**
>
> | Field in `settings.json` | What it is for |
> |---|---|
> | `url` | Dispatcharr base URL |
> | `dispatcharr_api_key` | **Dispatcharr REST API token** — ECM uses this to talk to Dispatcharr. (Canonical field name as of v0.17.1, GH #273. Operators upgrading from v0.17.0 or earlier will have the value in the legacy `api_key` field; ECM auto-migrates on next startup with a one-time `[CONFIG] Reading deprecated 'api_key' field …` WARN log.) Never replace it with an MCP key. |
> | `api_key` | **DEPRECATED legacy alias for `dispatcharr_api_key`.** ECM still reads this for one release of back-compat (v0.17.x). The first read after upgrade emits a deprecation WARN and mirrors the value into `dispatcharr_api_key` on the next save. |
>
> **MCP key authority (separate from Dispatcharr settings)**
>
> Generate, regenerate, or revoke the MCP client key only through **Settings >
> MCP Integration**. Copy the generated or regenerated key from the UI into
> each client. The owner-only `/run/secrets/ecm-mcp/api-key` projection is the
> sole live authority for inbound MCP authentication. The
> `settings.json:mcp_api_key` field is only a compatibility mirror; generic
> settings saves and manual changes cannot promote it over the authority and
> instead repair it from the validated projection. An explicitly empty
> authority is durable revocation.
>
> The separate `mcp-service.json` projection contains the sidecar's private
> backend and confirmation credentials. Operators never copy those credentials
> into a client. `.api-key.recovery` is an internal redo record for interrupted
> rotation or revocation; do not edit or delete it as cleanup.
>
> Do **not** put the MCP key in `dispatcharr_api_key` (or its legacy `api_key`
> alias): doing so breaks every channel and stream operation because
> Dispatcharr rejects the wrong credential. If `/health` reports
> `api_key_configured: false`, its status distinguishes an absent
> (`file_not_found`), blank (`field_empty`), or malformed/unreadable
> (`invalid_key`) projection. Read it with
> `GET http://localhost:6101/health` on the Docker host.
>
> **Migration example.** A v0.17.0 `settings.json` from an operator hit by GH #273:
> ```json
> {
>   "url": "http://dispatcharr:9191",
>   "api_key": "REDACTED_DISPATCHARR_REST_TOKEN"
> }
> ```
> After the first v0.17.1 startup and the next settings save, the file becomes:
> ```json
> {
>   "url": "http://dispatcharr:9191",
>   "dispatcharr_api_key": "REDACTED_DISPATCHARR_REST_TOKEN",
>   "api_key": "REDACTED_DISPATCHARR_REST_TOKEN"
> }
> ```
> Both fields hold the same Dispatcharr token. The duplicate is intentional so
> external scripts that still read `api_key` keep working. ECM handles the
> migration and compatibility writes; neither field is an MCP credential.

1. **Generate an API key** in ECM Settings > MCP Integration and copy the displayed key for your MCP client. ECM publishes the authoritative projection and compatibility mirror automatically.
2. **Start the MCP container** — add the `ecm-mcp` service to your compose file (see [With MCP Server](#with-mcp-server-claude-ai-integration)) and start it on port 6101
3. **Connect Claude** — choose your method:

### Choose your connection method

ECM's MCP server is authenticated with the public MCP client key in an `Authorization: Bearer` header. The default deployment is available only on the Docker host's loopback interface. Use the HTTPS remote profile above for access from another machine.

| Method | Node.js? | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| [Claude Desktop — mcp-remote bridge](#claude-desktop--mcp-remote-bridge-node-required) | Yes (LTS 18+ on the Claude Desktop machine) | Claude Desktop users; private/homelab deploys; existing setups |
| [Claude Code — `.mcp.json`](#claude-code-mcpjson) | No | Claude Code in any project; direct HTTP, no Node.js |

---

### Claude Desktop — mcp-remote bridge (Node required)

✅ **Works on a private network — no public exposure.** `mcp-remote` runs **on your machine** and connects to ECM over your LAN/VPN, so ECM never has to be reachable from the internet (the cost is needing Node.js on the Claude Desktop machine).

Claude Desktop talks to remote MCP servers through the `mcp-remote` bridge. Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

> **Prerequisite:** Claude Desktop does **not** bundle Node.js. The `mcp-remote` bridge is an npm package that Claude Desktop runs via `npx`, so you need Node.js installed on the same machine as Claude Desktop (any current LTS — Node 18+ — is fine). Install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (or via a package manager: `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` on Windows, `brew install node` on macOS, `apt install nodejs npm` on Debian/Ubuntu). Without Node on PATH, Claude Desktop fails to launch the MCP server with a `spawn npx ENOENT` error in its logs.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ecm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:6101/mcp",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${ECM_MCP_AUTH}",
        "--allow-http"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Set `ECM_MCP_AUTH` in the operating-system environment to `Bearer <your key>`
before starting Claude Desktop. `--allow-http` is appropriate only for this
loopback URL; use `https://` and omit it for remote access.

> **Note:** the Bearer value is the MCP key copied from Settings > MCP
> Integration, not the Dispatcharr REST token in `dispatcharr_api_key` or its
> legacy `api_key` alias.

---

### Claude Code (`.mcp.json`)

✅ **Works on a private network — no Node.js, no public exposure.** Claude Code speaks the HTTP transport natively and connects directly from your machine, so a LAN/VPN-reachable ECM is all you need. This is the simplest private path if you use Claude Code.

Create a `.mcp.json` file in any project directory where you want ECM tools available:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ecm": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:6101/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${ECM_MCP_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To connect:
1. Set `ECM_MCP_API_KEY` in your local environment and create the `.mcp.json` above
2. Start Claude Code in that directory — it auto-detects `.mcp.json` on launch
3. Run `/mcp` to reconnect if the MCP server restarts
4. Ask Claude to manage your channels — e.g. "list my channels", "create a Channel Pipeline rule for sports", "probe all streams"

If running ECM locally, use `localhost` as your host. If the MCP container is on the same Docker network as Claude Code, use the container name (`ecm-mcp`).

---

**Upgrading from an earlier version:** remove `?api_key=...` from every MCP URL and configure the Bearer header shown above. The deprecated SSE endpoints remain removed. Rotate the old key through Settings > MCP Integration after removing URL-based configs because URLs may have been retained in logs or histories.

**Redeploying or rotating the MCP key:** use Settings > MCP Integration > Regenerate Key, copy the returned key, then update the local environment variable used for the Bearer header. Rotation is effective on the next request without restarting the sidecar. Revoke access with Settings > MCP Integration > Revoke Key. Do **not** edit server-side credential projection files or `dispatcharr_api_key` (or its legacy `api_key` alias).

**For the full reference** — step-by-step connection setup, key rotation details, and troubleshooting — see **[docs/user_guide/integrations/mcp.md](docs/user_guide/integrations/mcp.md)**.
