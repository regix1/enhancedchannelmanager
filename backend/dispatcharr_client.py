    The Dispatcharr client surfaces upstream failures in two shapes:

    1. ``httpx.HTTPStatusError`` — from helpers that call
       ``response.raise_for_status()`` (e.g. ``create_epg_source``,
       ``delete_channel_group``, ``get_channel``). Carries ``.response``.
    2. A bare ``Exception`` whose message is
       ``"<thing> failed: <status> - <body>"`` — from helpers that build the
       error string by hand (e.g. ``create_channel``, ``create_channel_group``).

    For an upstream **4xx** this returns an ``HTTPException`` that preserves the
    actionable upstream status + detail (404 stays 404; every other 4xx maps to
    400 with the upstream detail so the caller sees *why* the request was
    rejected instead of an opaque 500). For anything else (5xx, connection
    errors, non-matching exceptions) it returns ``None`` so the caller falls
    through to its generic ``500 Internal server error`` handler. This keeps
    genuine server faults as 500 while exposing actionable client errors.

    Imported lazily inside callers' ``except`` blocks; FastAPI's
    ``HTTPException`` is imported here to avoid a module-level web-framework

        headers.

            The image bytes, or ``None`` when the upstream returned any error
            status (a deleted logo, a cache miss Dispatcharr could not fill).

        exposes ``password`` as a WRITE-ONLY plaintext field and there is no

        (write-only upstream), never logged, and never recorded by ECM — the

        The error message uses the same ``"<thing> failed: <status> - <body>"``

        ``/api/core/settings/{integer id}/`` — there is NO key-string detail
        route (see ``tests/fixtures/dispatcharr_openapi_recorded.json``). Ids are

        ``{"results": [...], "next": ...}`` envelope. When paginated, EVERY page
        is fetched until exhausted (the live recorded response is a bare list
        today, but the docstring has long claimed paginated-envelope support
        and a future/larger settings list could genuinely paginate): a non-null
        ``next`` is treated as a more-pages SIGNAL, not a URL to dereference —
        this client's ``_request`` convention takes a path only, so each
        subsequent page is re-requested against the SAME ``_CORE_SETTINGS_PATH``
        with an incrementing ``page`` query param, never the literal ``next``
        URL. This assumes Dispatcharr's page-numbered DRF pagination; it would
        stop working (falsely conclude "no more pages" after page 1) if a
        future Dispatcharr switched this endpoint to cursor/offset-based
        pagination, where ``next`` doesn't correspond to a plain incrementing
        page number — the :data:`_CORE_SETTINGS_MAX_PAGES` cap below is the
        backstop for a runaway/mismatched pagination scheme, not a fix for that
        case. Bounded by :data:`_CORE_SETTINGS_MAX_PAGES` so a misbehaving or
        infinitely-linking destination cannot hang a restore run; exceeding the
        cap raises loudly rather than silently returning a partial map. A row
        without a usable string key or an integer id is DROPPED rather than
        guessed at — an absent key makes the caller fail that key explicitly,
        whereas a guessed id would PATCH an unrelated setting.

        Raises:
