"""session_telemetry: denormalize Dispatcharr username + drop ECM users FK

Revision ID: 0011
Revises: 0010
Create Date: 2026-05-15 17:00:00.000000

Stats v2 architectural fix for the namespace-collision bug bd-uqbob worked
around with an env-var exclude filter. Two changes in one migration because
they touch the same column space and SQLite batch-mode rebuilds the entire
table either way:

1. Add column ``dispatcharr_username TEXT NULL``. The writer
   (``BandwidthTracker._write_session_telemetry``) populates this directly
   from the per-poll Dispatcharr ``user_id → username`` map it already
   maintains for the bd-uqbob exclude filter — zero extra round-trips.
   Read APIs surface this verbatim instead of joining
   ``session_telemetry.user_id`` against ECM's local ``users`` table.

2. Drop the FK constraint on ``session_telemetry.user_id`` →
   ``users.id``. ECM's local ``users`` table (auth identities for ECM
   logins) and Dispatcharr's ``users`` table (stream viewers) are two
   separate namespaces with coincidentally-overlapping integer IDs. The
   FK was a structural lie — it joined behavioral telemetry from one
   namespace to identity rows in another, and the join returned wrong
   answers (Dispatcharr viewer id=3 surfaced as ECM admin "claude" in
   the Watch Time panel when their integer ids collided). The column
   stays as an opaque Dispatcharr-side integer; ``_coerce_session_user_id``
   still scrubs the anonymous ``0`` sentinel so analytics queries see
   ``NULL`` rather than the noise value.

PO directive (verbatim, 2026-05-13):
    "1 is the correct choice, because we should be able to get the
    active user account from the Dispatcharr API; we never need to
    touch a table."

Backfill / pre-migration rows: NOT auto-applied. Pre-migration rows
keep ``dispatcharr_username = NULL`` and the read APIs surface them
gracefully ("Unknown viewer" on the frontend). The Stats v2 history-
cutover policy from bd-skqln.3 ("accept the gap") covers this — the
panel was already wrong about user attribution before this fix; the
pre-migration rows now honestly admit that. Operators who want a
clean slate can purge with the existing one-liner from the bd-uqbob
CHANGELOG entry. Backfilling via a startup-time Dispatcharr lookup
was rejected: it would couple migration completion to network
availability and would still be guessing at attribution for sessions
where the client_user_map mapping is no longer recoverable.

SQLite specifics:

* Adding ``dispatcharr_username`` is a normal ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN``
  in SQLite — works without batch mode.

* Dropping the ``user_id`` FK requires a full table rebuild (SQLite
  has no ``ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT``). We use
  ``batch_alter_table`` with an explicit ``table_args`` listing the
  remaining constraints (just the named CHECK on ``bytes_delta``);
  the FK is omitted from that list, which is how Alembic's batch
  mode "drops" a constraint — the rebuilt table copies forward
  every column AND row but only the constraints we list.

* The ``channel_watch_stats_v`` view (created in 0008) references
  ``session_telemetry``. SQLite refuses to rename through a view, so
  the batch dance must drop and recreate the view around the alter
  — same pattern migration 0010 uses. The view DDL is held verbatim
  here so the migration is self-contained; the
  ``TestMigration0008::test_view_round_trip_ddl_is_stable`` canary
  in ``test_alembic_smoke.py`` keeps the two copies honest.

bd-5w6jz idempotency: long-running installs where ``init_db``'s
``Base.metadata.create_all()`` had already added ``dispatcharr_username``
to ``session_telemetry`` from the post-0011 ORM model in ``models.py``,
or where the smart-bootstrap fast-path stamped through this revision
without dropping the FK, would re-run the migration on the next start.
The guards:

* Skip the column add if ``dispatcharr_username`` is already present
  (the bd-m2k7p / bd-kh23e column-add idempotency pattern).
* Skip the FK-drop batch if ``user_id`` already has no FK in the
  live schema (``inspect().get_foreign_keys()`` returns no entry
  whose constrained columns include ``user_id``).
* If both are no-ops, return early — the table-copy cost of an
  unnecessary batch rebuild is non-trivial on a 26M-row deployment.

Pre-merge gate: ``backend/tests/integration/test_alembic_smoke.py::TestMigration0011``
covers fresh up, fresh down, idempotency on the column path, and
idempotency on the FK-drop path.
