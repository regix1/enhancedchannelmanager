"""sync_targets provisioning markers (ADR-013 S10-S13 one-time credential provisioning)

Revision ID: 0046
Revises: 0045
Create Date: 2026-08-22 12:00:00.000000

Additive, reversible extension of ``sync_targets`` for the one-time credential
provisioning feature (bead enhancedchannelmanager-wd20y; ADR-013 amendment
2026-08-22, decisions S10-S13; threat model §11.5 rows D11-D16).

Two NULLABLE columns are added, and neither ever holds a credential (INV-3 —
harvested values are read, written to B and discarded inside the request):

* ``credentials_provisioned_at`` DATETIME NULL — the S11 gate marker. Set on a
  provisioning that succeeded, cleared only by a de-provision whose write to B
  succeeded for EVERY targeted account (INV-9). A target may not be both
  "TLS verification disabled" and "provisioned"; this column is the recorded
  half of that predicate.
* ``destination_credential_observed_at`` DATETIME NULL — the OBSERVED half
  (threat model row D16; PO ruling 2026-08-22 on §11.5.4 item 5). Stamped by
  the sync cycle from state it already reads: the credential re-entry reporter
  already runs ``credential_sentinel.credential_is_present`` against B's own
  account rows. Presence only — never a value, never a comparison.

Why COLUMNS and not an inference from journal / execution history: bead
enhancedchannelmanager-5dp92 records that execution history is keyed on a
REUSABLE target id, so a freshly created target can inherit a deleted target's
rows. An "is there a provisioning row for this id?" gate would inherit a
provisioned verdict it never earned, or lose one it did.

Both adds are NULLABLE, so no ``server_default`` is needed (NULL is the correct
"never provisioned" / "never observed" sentinel for existing rows) — the same
shape as the nullable bookkeeping adds in 0024.

Idempotency (house pattern, see 0024 / 0040): each ADD COLUMN is guarded by a
column-presence check, so a DB that drifted forward via ``create_all()`` passes
through as a no-op rather than raising ``OperationalError: duplicate column``.

Reversibility: ``downgrade()`` drops both columns via ``batch_alter_table``
(SQLite cannot DROP COLUMN without table recreation). Dropping them loses the
provisioning gate state only — target rows and credentials are preserved.
Reverting the code does NOT retract credentials already written to B (ADR-013,
"What a de-provision cannot guarantee").
