app = FastAPI(
    title="Enhanced Channel Manager API",
    description="""
## Overview
Enhanced Channel Manager (ECM) provides a powerful API for managing IPTV channels,
M3U playlists, EPG data, and more.

## Features
- **Channel Management**: Create, organize, and manage TV channels
- **M3U Integration**: Import and sync M3U playlists from multiple providers
- **EPG Support**: Manage Electronic Program Guide data sources
- **Stream Monitoring**: Track stream health and statistics
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Automate refresh and maintenance tasks
- **Notifications**: Get alerts via Discord, Email, or Telegram

## Authentication
All API endpoints require JWT authentication. Obtain a token via `POST /api/auth/login`
and include it as a Bearer token or session cookie. The interactive docs at `/api/docs`
handle authentication automatically when accessed through the web UI.

## Rate Limiting
Login endpoints are rate-limited to 5 requests per minute per IP address.

# Auth decision — same trade-off already accepted for /metrics: Dispatcharr
# consumes ECM's dummy EPG by registering /api/dummy-epg/xmltv/<profile_id> as
# an XMLTV source, and its fetcher has nowhere to put an ECM credential (this
# API takes a bearer token in a header only; there is no query-parameter
# credential path). With auth on, gating these reads makes the dummy EPG
# feature unable to deliver guide data at all, so they answer without
# authentication on the assumption that ECM's network is trusted (LAN /
# reverse proxy / tailnet). What is readable if that assumption stops holding:
# channel names and programme titles for the generated events, nothing else.
# The follow-up if it does is either an IP allowlist at the reverse proxy
# (simplest, no code change) or a per-profile token in the URL validated in
# the handler.
#
# Only GET and HEAD are exempt, so a mutating route added under this prefix
# later still requires a token. Every path starting with one of these strings
# is readable by anyone, so keep new dummy-epg routes outside the xmltv prefix.

#       The entry-point HTML references the hashed bundles by name. It MUST
#       be revalidated on every load so a fresh deploy's bundle URLs are
#       picked up. Without this, browsers / proxies that apply heuristic
#       caching to HTML hand users a stale index.html pointing at a
#       /assets/index-<old-hash>.js that has been removed from disk —
#       producing 404s and the kind:"chunk_load" client-error spike that
#       docs/runbooks/frontend_error_rate.md alerts on.

# Operator-facing cache-invalidation procedure:
#   docs/runbooks/infra-cache-invalidation.md (companion runbook, covers
