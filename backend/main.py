app = FastAPI(
    title="Enhanced Channel Manager API",
    description="""
## Overview
Enhanced Channel Manager (ECM) provides a powerful API for managing IPTV channels,
M3U playlists, EPG data, and more.

## Features
- **Channel Management**: Create, organize, and manage TV channels
- **M3U Integration**: Import and sync M3U playlists from multiple providers
- **EPG Support**: Manage Electronic Program Guide data sources
- **Stream Monitoring**: Track stream health and statistics
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Automate refresh and maintenance tasks
- **Notifications**: Get alerts via Discord, Email, or Telegram

## Authentication
All API endpoints require JWT authentication. Obtain a token via `POST /api/auth/login`
and include it as a Bearer token or session cookie. The interactive docs at `/api/docs`
handle authentication automatically when accessed through the web UI.

## Rate Limiting
Login endpoints are rate-limited to 5 requests per minute per IP address.

# middleware piggy-backs on the same request cycle to emit counter/histogram
# samples labeled by route *pattern* — NOT raw path — so cardinality stays
# bounded regardless of traffic mix.

# middleware section (after auth_middleware / actor_source_middleware) so it
# wraps EVERYTHING — including requests the auth middleware rejects with 401.
# When it was registered first (innermost), auth rejections short-circuited
# before ever reaching it: no structured ecm.access line, no metrics sample,
# no X-Request-ID header on 401s.

    #     (``routers.backup._guard_initial_restore``), which inspects instance
    #     state — does a user row exist? — independently of setup_complete, so
    #     the restore gate remains safe if configuration persistence is ever
    #     interrupted or damaged.
    # Removing the exemption therefore adds no new refusal; it prevents the

# Auth decision — same trade-off already accepted for /metrics: Dispatcharr
# consumes ECM's dummy EPG by registering /api/dummy-epg/xmltv/<profile_id> as
# an XMLTV source, and its fetcher has nowhere to put an ECM credential (this
# API takes a bearer token in a header only; there is no query-parameter
# credential path). With auth on, gating these reads makes the dummy EPG
# feature unable to deliver guide data at all, so they answer without
# authentication on the assumption that ECM's network is trusted (LAN /
# reverse proxy / tailnet). What is readable if that assumption stops holding:
# channel names and programme titles for the generated events, nothing else.
# The follow-up if it does is either an IP allowlist at the reverse proxy
# (simplest, no code change) or a per-profile token in the URL validated in
# the handler.
#
# Only GET and HEAD are exempt, so a mutating route added under this prefix
# later still requires a token. Every path starting with one of these strings
# is readable by anyone, so keep new dummy-epg routes outside the xmltv prefix.

# The 422 handler below never puts a request-body VALUE into a log line or a
# response, on any path. That is unconditional by design, and the design is the
# fix rather than an implementation detail.
#
# WHAT CAME BEFORE. Bead enhancedchannelmanager-2owpi replaced a single
# hardcoded "/api/auth" check with a module constant,
# CREDENTIAL_BEARING_BODY_PREFIXES, seeded with "/api/auth" and "/api/tls" —
# the two the bead had evidence for. A Codex pre-merge review of the same
# branch then named four more credential-bearing routes the constant did not
# cover, all of which were still logging their raw bodies at ERROR and echoing
# them to the caller:
#
#   POST /api/settings          SettingsRequest carries the Dispatcharr
#                               password, the Dispatcharr API key, SMTP
#                               credentials, the Discord webhook URL and the
#                               Telegram bot token.
#   POST|PATCH /api/cloud-targets   an arbitrary ``credentials`` mapping.
#   POST|PUT   /api/sync-targets    an arbitrary ``credentials`` mapping.
#   POST|PATCH /api/admin/users     a plaintext ``password``.
#
# Those four were the ones a human review surfaced. Walking the live app for
# write routes whose request models hold credential-shaped fields put the real
# figure at SIXTEEN route/model pairs outside the two covered prefixes, adding
# among others POST /api/settings/test-smtp, /test-discord, /test-telegram, the
# Emby/Plex/Jellyfin test-connection routes, POST /api/cloud-targets/test and
# POST /api/epg/migration/apply. That walk is
# tests/routers/test_9kwzp_validation_error_body_redaction.py, and the gap
# between "four found by reading" and "sixteen found by walking" is the whole
# argument below.
#
# WHY THE MECHANISM CHANGED AND NOT JUST ITS CONTENTS. Those four are an
# indictment of the allowlist, not of whoever wrote it. A list of
# credential-bearing prefixes has to be extended by hand every time a route
# starts accepting a secret, and the cost of forgetting is paid silently: the
# unlisted route defaults to LEAKING, the tests stay green, and nothing tells
# anyone. Appending the sixteen missing prefixes would have restored exactly
# the state that produced them, and left the seventeenth to be found the same
# way.
#
# ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERED AND REJECTED: redact by field NAME instead of by
# route, matching against the credential-key denylist that routers/backup.py
# already maintains. That has the same shape of defect one layer down. It
# swaps a hand-maintained list of paths for a hand-maintained list of field
# names, and a credential whose name nobody anticipated (an opaque vendor
# token, "pat", "signing_key") defaults to leaking again. A denylist cannot
# have a fail-closed default, because its default IS the deny list being
# incomplete. That is acceptable for the backup redactor, whose job is to
# preserve as much of an artifact as it safely can; it is the wrong trade for a
# debug log line whose entire content is discretionary.
#
# So: no list, no per-route knob, nothing to remember. When someone adds a
# credential-bearing route tomorrow and reads none of this, its body is
# redacted because every body is redacted.
#
# WHAT SURVIVES, SO THIS IS NOT A LOSS OF DIAGNOSTICS. Only body VALUES are
# withheld. Every validation error keeps its ``loc`` (which field), ``msg``
# (what was wrong with it) and ``type`` (the pydantic error class), on every
# path, so a 422 still tells the caller precisely which field to fix and why.
# The one diagnostic that goes is pydantic's ``input`` echo of the offending
# value, and on a missing-field error that ``input`` is the whole request body
# anyway (which is why redacting ``exc.body`` alone was never sufficient).
#
# Note also that cloud_storage.upload_security.redact_secrets does NOT rescue
# this path and never did: its key/value rule needs the key name adjacent to
# the separator, and JSON puts a closing quote in between, so
# {"aws_secret_access_key": "..."} passes through it untouched.
