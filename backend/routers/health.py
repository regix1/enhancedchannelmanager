"""
Health & cache router — health check and cache management endpoints.

Two health endpoints with distinct purposes:

- ``/api/health``: cheap liveness probe. Returns 200 with version metadata.
  Called every 30s by the Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK, so it must stay fast and
  must NOT depend on external subsystems (DB, Dispatcharr, ffprobe). If this
  endpoint returns non-200, the container is considered unhealthy — we don't
  want a transient Dispatcharr outage to mark the whole app as down.

- ``/api/health/ready``: rich readiness probe. Verifies the app can actually
  do work by checking DB connectivity, Dispatcharr reachability (cached 30s
  to avoid hammering), and ffprobe availability. Returns 200 when all
  subsystems are healthy, 503 when any required subsystem is degraded
  (standard readiness convention).

Extracted from main.py (Phase 2 of v0.13.0 backend refactor). Rich readiness
added per bead enhancedchannelmanager-w0iyw (SRE operability improvement).
