"""Sync Targets router — CRUD for cross-instance live-sync destinations.

A SyncTarget is a remote Dispatcharr-B instance ECM can push config to
(epic i39wu, bead vigbu). This router mirrors the CloudStorageTarget CRUD in
``routers/cloud_targets.py`` exactly:

* credentials are Fernet-encrypted at rest via ``cloud_storage.crypto`` and are
  NEVER returned decrypted — every response masks them (last-4 only);
* ``credential_version`` bumps same-txn when credentials, ``base_url``, or
  ``insecure`` changes via the ORM listener (``export_models.py``); a rename or
  enable-toggle does NOT bump it;
* every route is admin-gated (``auth.RequireAdminIfEnabled``), reads and writes
  alike, and that gate ADMITS the static MCP service principal — see
  :func:`create_sync_target` for why (bead 9kwzp.10).

base_url validation
-------------------
On create/update the ``base_url`` must be a well-formed http(s) URL; other
schemes / unparseable values are rejected at write time (see
``_validate_base_url``). This is a config-time best-effort check ONLY.

The AUTHORITATIVE SSRF defence — resolve-by-IP against the always-on denylist
+ active mode, with DNS-rebinding mitigation — runs at sync EXECUTE time via
``security/ssrf.py`` ``validate_outbound_url`` (bead 1t3al / the sync engine),
NOT here. Config-time scheme/format validation alone is insufficient against
DNS rebinding (the host can resolve to an internal IP between config and
execute), which is exactly why the execute-time gate re-resolves and connects
by the validated IP. We deliberately do NOT call the (synchronous, blocking,
fail-closed) ``validate_outbound_url`` at write time: it would reject a
legitimately-configured target whose host is merely unresolvable at the moment
of saving, and DNS done here proves nothing about DNS at execute time.

# Any update happens as soon as the next scheduled sync occurs."

# (``tasks.dbas_sync_engine.PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_SECTIONS``), and this router is
# back to plain CRUD. Deleted with the routes:
#
# * ``POST /{id}/provision-credentials`` and ``/{id}/deprovision-credentials``;
# * ``_guard_insecure_write`` — the S11 refusal that returned 409 when a target
#   holding a credential was set ``insecure``, in both write orders. It is now a
#   WARNING the cycle emits on every credential-carrying run
#   (``insecure_transmission_warning``) and the SyncTargets card renders. The PO
#   owns that risk explicitly: "That's on the user to mitigate, not us."
# * the ``credentials_provisioned_at`` / ``destination_credential_observed_at``
#   markers (migration 0047 drops the columns).
#
# The ONE thing an operator still types is the Schedules Direct password, and
# they type it once: it is a write-only field on this row (see
# ``SyncTargetCreate.schedules_direct_password``), because Dispatcharr never
# returns it and there is nothing on this instance to harvest.

    all five routes were already admin-gated, so the only question was whether
    admitting the MCP service principal is intended. Verdict: yes, on all five,
    writes included.

    Bead jcj0f shipped ``create_sync_target`` / ``update_sync_target`` /
    ``delete_sync_target`` as MCP tools deliberately, and managing
    cross-instance sync destinations is work the sidecar exists to do. Denying
    the principal here breaks those three tools outright, and that capability
    loss is not worth what the denial buys.

    Recorded so the residual is visible rather than implied: a write names a
    remote host, stores the credentials this instance authenticates to it with,
    sets ``insecure`` (which turns off TLS verification for that traffic), and
    registers or refreshes the target's ``dbas_sync_<id>`` scheduled task, so
    an update can repoint a push the operator already configured. The module
    docstring above is explicit that the AUTHORITATIVE SSRF check runs at sync
    EXECUTE time, not here. Encryption at rest, the last-4 masking on responses
    and ``_redact_credentials_deep`` on the outbound payload all bound
    DISCLOSURE, not redirection.

    What remains in force is that the caller must be an admin — the plain gate
    closes the non-admin half completely — and that the outbound POLICY write
    (``PATCH /api/settings/security``, which is what would widen
