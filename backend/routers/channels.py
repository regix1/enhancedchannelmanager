def describe_channel_update(
    before_channel: dict, data: dict
) -> tuple[list[str], dict, dict]:
    """Reduce a channel PATCH payload to ``(changes, before_value, after_value)``.

    ``changes`` is the human-readable phrase list a journal description joins
    with ", "; the two dicts carry only the fields that actually moved, so an
    expanded journal row shows the edit rather than the whole record.

    Both the ``PATCH /api/channels/{id}`` handler (the path an MCP agent takes,
    and the one that has always written per-channel rows) and the Edit Mode
    bulk-commit executor call this. Before bead enhancedchannelmanager-r9py9
    only the former journaled at all, so a channel's history was traceable by
    name for AI-sourced edits and invisible for UI-sourced ones.

    TOTAL OVER THE PAYLOAD, which is the property fix round 4 of bead
    ``enhancedchannelmanager-kz089`` had to establish. Both callers PATCH a
    free-form ``data`` bag upstream WHOLE and then ask this function whether a
    row is owed; an empty ``changes`` is what lets the bulk executor say
    ``nothing_to_journal``. While the loop only knew the eight described
    fields, ``data={"streams": [7]}`` changed channel 42 upstream and was
    reported as describing no change — a landed mutation with no journal row,
    which is the exact defect the required-``journal_row`` argument was
    supposed to have made unreachable. A field the describers have no prose for
    is therefore still a change, named generically, with its values carried in
    ``before_value`` / ``after_value``. Coverage is total by construction, so a
    field nobody has invented yet cannot reopen this.

    Empty ``changes`` now means one thing only: every field in ``data`` was
    already holding that value. ``before_channel`` may be ``{}``, or may simply
    not carry a field, when the before-state is unknown — a channel created
    earlier in the same batch, a catalog read that failed. "I cannot see what
    it was" is not "it did not change", so an unknown before-state reads as a
    change on both arms rather than as silence.

    AN UNKNOWN BEFORE-STATE IS NAMED, not defaulted (fix round 5). Round 4
    established that it counts as a change and then recorded it with
    ``before_channel.get(field)``, which is ``None`` — the same serialisation
    an explicitly-null before-state produces. ``before_channel = {}`` with
    ``data = {"custom_prop": None}`` therefore wrote
    ``{"before": {"custom_prop": null}, "after": {"custom_prop": null}}``:
    evidence that something changed, and no evidence of what. A field whose
    before-state ``before_channel`` does not carry is listed under
    :data:`BEFORE_STATE_UNKNOWN_KEY` instead of being given a value ECM never
    read, so a row always distinguishes "it held null" from "I could not see
    it" — which is the difference between an operator being able to reconcile
    the edit and merely being told one happened.

    raising, so ignoring its return value loses the whole batch's audit trail
    in silence. ``journal.log_entry`` reports the same failure by returning
    ``None``. Both return values are checked here.

    When the batch write fails, the rows are retried one at a time: the
    realistic failure is a single unwritable row, and a batch write lets that
    one row take every other row's audit trail with it. Anything still
    unwritable after that is logged at ERROR with its full content, because an
    upstream mutation with no journal row is exactly what an operator later has

    over: a read-only or unavailable journal database produced a landed
    Dispatcharr change, no row, and a ``200`` that mentioned neither. A second
    implementation would have been a second thing to keep in step, so there is
    one, at module scope, taking the batch correlation id and the log tag its
    caller writes under.

    NOTHING IS LOST TO A ``BaseException``. Neither retry above catches one —
    ``SystemExit``, ``KeyboardInterrupt``, or a ``CancelledError`` raised by a
    synchronous dependency are not ``Exception`` — and the bulk caller has
    already DRAINED these rows off the ledger by the time this runs, so there
    is no queue left to retry them from and no second flush to do it. Every row
    this call has not yet resolved is therefore logged before the

    THE ONE MECHANISM, shared by every request handler that queues rows and

    carried this precedence guard as `unwinding_base_exception`, and the
    reasoning that a request handler had no analogue was wrong: the guard is
    not about keeping ``task.cancelled()`` true, it is about which exception
    reaches the caller.

    ``write_journal_rows`` RE-RAISES ``BaseException`` by design — it logs
    every row it has not resolved first, but it does not swallow. So a handler
    already unwinding an ``asyncio.CancelledError`` from a client disconnect,
    or an ``HTTPException`` it raised deliberately, whose synchronous journal
    dependency then raises ``SystemExit`` or ``KeyboardInterrupt`` inside this
    flush, had its original exception REPLACED. A disconnected request became
    worker termination, and an operator-actionable 422 became a 500.

    ``unwinding`` is therefore what the caller has already observed about its
    own exit: ``True`` when something is on its way out of the ``try``,
    ``False`` on the ordinary return. It is NOT a blanket ``except
    BaseException: pass`` — that would be the same bug pointing the other way,
    silently uncancelling a task when the flush on a clean return raised a
    ``CancelledError`` of its own. Nothing is swallowed while nothing is

    A WRAPPER RATHER THAN A BARE ``Optional[float]``, because ``null`` is a
    legitimate expectation — "I believe this channel has no number" — and a bare
    optional cannot tell that apart from "I am not making a claim". The object's

    IT IS A CHECK AND NOT A GUARANTEE, and the difference is measured rather

    read at the start of the run and a change landing between that read and the

    """Consolidate redundant operations to minimize API calls.

    Optimizations:
    - Multiple updateChannel for same channel -> single update with merged data
    - Multiple bulkAssignChannelNumbers -> single call with final positions
    - Stream add/remove/reorder operations pass through in submitted order
    - Non-stream operations targeting channels to be deleted are removed
    - Create + delete of same temp channel cancel out

    LAST WRITE WINS, AND "LAST" IS BY SUBMITTED POSITION RATHER THAN BY KIND.
    The output groups operations by kind — merged updates, then range
    assignments — so the order they are EMITTED in says nothing about the order
    they were SENT in. That destroyed the caller's ordering between kinds:
    ``bulkAssignChannelNumbers([1], 10)`` followed by
    ``updateChannel(1, {"channel_number": 20})`` emitted the update first and
    the range last, so a plan whose final state is 20 — which is what both
    materialisers in ``channel_number_plan.py`` and ``channelNumberPlan.ts``
    preview, and therefore what the operator was shown — was validated and
    applied as 10.

    So the channel's final number is resolved ONCE here, by submitted index,
    across every kind that sets one, and the losing operation has the number
    taken off it. Exactly one operation in the output writes any given
    channel's number, which is what makes the emission order unable to change
    the answer.

    THE NUMBER COMES OFF THE LOSER; THE LOSER DOES NOT ALWAYS COME OFF. A
    superseded update with nothing else to PATCH is dropped, because it existed
    only to write that number. A superseded CREATE is always emitted, because
    it is what makes the channel exist and every operation naming its temp id
    depends on it — only its number and the consent describing that placement
    come off. That distinction is the fix-round-4 defect: creates were copied
    into the output untouched, so a create whose number a later operation owned
    was emitted carrying it and the channel was written twice.

# retries, piling duplicates into Dispatcharr.

#                                 before commit, where a poll round-trip would

        ``CancelledError`` is unwinding (fix round 4), and a coroutine that
        awaited anything there would simply be cancelled again at the first
        await — reopening the hole this call is closing. Nothing it touches is
        async: :func:`write_journal_rows` and ``journal.log_entry`` are both
        blocking calls. It does not follow that it never raises a
        ``BaseException``: a synchronous dependency can, and the outer
        ``finally`` is written so that one cannot replace the cancellation it
        is unwinding (fix round 5).

        Called from :func:`finish`, which is the only way out of this function
        by RETURN once execution has started — every early return, every
        partial batch failure and the outer exception handler all go through
        it — and from the outer ``finally``, which covers the ways out that are
        not returns. Before bead …-kz089 fix round 2 the journal writes were
        the last statements of the happy path, so a Phase 1 group-create
        failure returned with group A already created upstream and no row
        saying so, and an exception anywhere after Phase 1 did the same for
        every operation that had landed.

        A journal failure is recorded on the ledger as a setup failure rather
        than swallowed: the mutations DID land, so nothing may be reported as
        failed, but the envelope has to say the audit trail is incomplete
        instead of looking like a clean commit.

        The rows come from the LEDGER, which queued each one as its write
        landed. Round 2 made this the single flush and left the rows in a list
        the branches appended to whenever they got round to it; a flush that
        cannot be skipped still writes nothing if the row was never built (fix
        round 3).
