# kgz3k — field-level admin gate for POST /api/settings.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# POST /api/settings is ONE blob that mixes admin-only configuration
# (outbound base URLs, integration secrets, notification credentials,
# Dispatcharr connection) with per-user display preferences (theme,
# date_format, timezone). The whole endpoint historically had NO admin
# dependency, so any authenticated caller — INCLUDING the static MCP API
# key — could rewrite outbound base URLs + API keys, turning the runtime
# media-server pollers into an SSRF + key-exfiltration primitive.
#
# We can't admin-gate the whole endpoint (that would break a non-admin
# saving their own theme/timezone), and we can't split the endpoint without
# a frontend rewrite. So the gate is FIELD-LEVEL: a non-admin (auth enabled)
# may change ONLY non-admin-only fields; any attempt to CHANGE an admin-only
# field is rejected 403. ``SettingsRequest`` field name -> ``DispatcharrSettings``
# attribute name; only the attribute on the LEFT is compared against the
# stored value, so a field whose value is unchanged never trips the gate
# (lets a non-admin POST the full settings blob the UI already holds).

    """Sanitize an operator-supplied base URL for media-server test endpoints.

    SSRF mitigation (security finding SEC-2 — bd-r5f0c.4 backfill,
    extended in bd-fbc50 with a loopback/link-local host denylist).
    Mirrors the Dispatcharr ``/test`` endpoint pattern (routers.settings.
    test_connection, around the ``urlparse`` + scheme allowlist +
    ``urlunparse((scheme, netloc, '', '', '', ''))`` reconstruction):

    1. Reject any scheme outside {http, https}. ``file://`` /
       ``gopher://`` / ``ftp://`` / etc. let an attacker pivot the
       proxy-server request through unintended protocols (file
       exfiltration, internal protocol smuggling).
    2. Reject when no hostname is present — without a hostname the
       client would either bind to a default loopback or raise late;
       fail-closed at the entry edge instead.
    3. Reject loopback / link-local hosts (bd-fbc50). An admin could
       otherwise point Test Connection at ``127.0.0.1`` / ``::1`` /
       ``localhost`` (services on the ECM host) or at the cloud
       instance-metadata IP ``169.254.169.254`` (credential theft).
       RFC1918 LAN ranges are intentionally LEFT reachable — see
       :func:`_ip_is_blocked`. Hostnames are resolved where feasible so a
       name pointing at a blocked IP is also caught.
    4. Reconstruct the URL from scheme + netloc ONLY, stripping any
       path / params / query / fragment the operator typed (or an
       attacker tried to embed). The downstream client builds its own
       paths off the base URL — preserving the operator's path would
       let a crafted ``http://attacker.com/legit/path?bypass`` survive
       to the HTTP probe.

    Returns:
        ``(sanitized_url, None)`` on success; ``(None, error_message)``
        on rejection. Callers route the error message into the
        ``{ok: False, error: <msg>}`` envelope so the UI surfaces an
        inline banner rather than a 500.
