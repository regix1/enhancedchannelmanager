# kgz3k — field-level admin gate for POST /api/settings.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# POST /api/settings is ONE blob that mixes admin-only configuration
# (outbound base URLs, integration secrets, notification credentials,
# Dispatcharr connection) with per-user display preferences (theme,
# date_format, timezone). The whole endpoint historically had NO admin
# dependency, so any authenticated caller — INCLUDING the static MCP API
# key — could rewrite outbound base URLs + API keys, turning the runtime
# media-server pollers into an SSRF + key-exfiltration primitive.
#
# We can't admin-gate the whole endpoint (that would break a non-admin
# saving their own theme/timezone), and we can't split the endpoint without
# a frontend rewrite. So the gate is FIELD-LEVEL: a non-admin (auth enabled)
# may change ONLY non-admin-only fields; any attempt to CHANGE an admin-only
# field is rejected 403. ``SettingsRequest`` field name -> ``DispatcharrSettings``
# attribute name; only the attribute on the LEFT is compared against the
# stored value, so a field whose value is unchanged never trips the gate
# (lets a non-admin POST the full settings blob the UI already holds).

# The set itself now lives in ``config`` as ``ADMIN_ONLY_READ_REDACTED_FIELDS``

# backup artifact producer has to redact exactly the same partition, and while
# the literal lived in this module it did not, so the MCP service principal read
# two of the three straight out of a standard backup. Both enforcement points
# derive from the one definition now — add a field in ``config`` and it is
# withheld on GET /api/settings AND redacted out of every artifact. The
# rationale for the READ gate stays here, where the gate is.
#
# These three are outbound notification credentials: a Discord webhook URL is a
# bearer capability to post into a server, and a Telegram bot token plus chat id
# is a bearer capability to post into a chat. They were returned verbatim by a
# GET that carried no dependency at all, so any authenticated non-admin and the
# static MCP service key could read them, while ``_resolve_settings_admin``
# goes to real lengths to deny those same principals WRITE on the same fields.
# Read is now gated by the same predicate as write: a field you may not write,
# you may not read.
#
# They stay in ``_ADMIN_ONLY_SETTINGS_FIELDS`` (compare-based) rather than
# moving to ``_ADMIN_ONLY_PROTECTED_FIELDS`` (any-non-empty-is-a-change)
# because an ADMIN must keep literal write semantics: blanking a webhook is how
# an operator disables the integration, and preserve-on-omit would take that
# away with no replacement affordance (there is no "clear" endpoint for the
# protected fields — see the Emby/Plex/Jellyfin keys). What the redaction needs
# instead is a single carve-out in ``_assert_admin_for_changed_fields``: an
# EMPTY value from a non-admin is the redacted placeholder coming back, not a
# request to clear.

    bead i4qrp: admin-gated, and the MCP service principal is refused. This
    endpoint carried NO route dependency while the sibling Emby / Plex /
    Jellyfin test endpoints carried ``RequireAdminIfEnabled``, so it was
    reachable by any authenticated caller including the static MCP key. The
    gate no-ops when ``require_auth`` is False or setup is incomplete, so the
    first-run configuration path is untouched (the only frontend callers are
    ``SettingsModal`` and the Settings tab, both post-authentication;
    ``SetupPage`` calls only ``completeSetup``).

    GH #754 / bead ``0yh70``: this endpoint used to carry its own inline
    scheme + netloc check and NO host policy at all, while POST /api/settings
    ran the full validator. Two consequences, both fixed by routing through
    the shared :func:`_sanitize_base_url`:

    * the reporter could prove ``http://localhost:9191`` worked here and then
      be refused permission to save it — a connection you can test but not
      store is its own defect, independent of the policy question;
    * it was an unguarded credential-carrying SSRF sink. It POSTs the
      operator-supplied username/password (or GETs with ``X-API-Key``) to any
      host the caller names, and echoes the upstream status back — a working
      internal port scanner that reached ``169.254.169.254`` while the
      equivalent Emby / Plex / Jellyfin endpoints were guarded.

        Runs ONLY after the connection itself has been verified, against the
        same already-SSRF-sanitized ``base_url`` and with the credential the
        test just proved. It is advisory in the strongest sense: any failure —
        an older Dispatcharr with no ``/api/core/version/`` route, a timeout, an
        unparseable body — returns ``None`` and the connection test's own
        verdict is untouched. It must never be able to turn a working
        connection into a reported failure.

        The probe goes through :meth:`DispatcharrClient.get_version` rather than
        a hand-written URL literal (PR #773 review, W1): a URL written out here
        is a URL the ADR-014 contract sweep cannot see, which is precisely the
        class of bug this bead exists to close. The client is built from the
        CANDIDATE credentials on the request — the connection test runs before
        anything is saved, so the ``get_client()`` singleton would be
        authenticating as the *previous* configuration, or as nothing at all.

        **Password mode reuses the access token the login just issued and
        cannot issue a second one.** Dispatcharr rate-limits login at 3/min per
        IP (this endpoint has a dedicated 429 branch because that budget is
        tight), so an advisory able to re-authenticate could burn it and make
        the operator's NEXT real test fail. Two things enforce that, because
        pre-seeding alone did not: seeding ``access_token`` short-circuits
        ``_ensure_authenticated`` on the way in, and ``retry_on_401=False``
        forbids ``_request``'s 401 branch, which — with no refresh token
        seeded — would otherwise fall through to a full ``_login()``. With no
        token to reuse the probe is skipped entirely.

        EVERYTHING the probe does, construction included, happens inside the
        ``try``: a ``DispatcharrClient``/``DispatcharrSettings`` built in front
        of the guard could raise and turn a verified-successful connection into
        a reported failure (PR #773 review, N1).

    GH #754 / bead ``0yh70``. This replaces the hardcoded, non-mode-aware
    loopback + link-local denylist that ``_sanitize_base_url`` used to carry
    (bd-fbc50). That denylist pre-empted the canonical validator: it rejected
    loopback unconditionally, so ``ssrf_outbound_mode`` — which ships as
    ``lan_friendly`` and explicitly permits loopback + RFC1918 + RFC 6598 per ADR-012 D4 —
    could never be honoured. A user running Dispatcharr behind a shared gluetun
    network (``http://localhost:9191`` is the only address that reaches it) had
    a working, testable connection that the save path refused to store.

    Policy now comes from ONE place, ``security.ssrf.validate_outbound_url``
    under the persisted mode:

    * always-on denylist (link-local / IMDS / ULA / multicast /
      ``0.0.0.0/8``) — rejected in BOTH modes, no opt-out;
    * wizard-toggled band (RFC1918 + RFC 6598 shared space + loopback) — allowed under
      ``lan_friendly``, rejected under ``public_only``;
    * every A/AAAA record is checked and ANY denied record rejects the whole
      URL (the DNS-rebinding mitigation, threat model §9.4 item 3).

    One deliberate adaptation for the settings surface: the chokepoint fails
    CLOSED on DNS resolution failure, which is right for the connect path but
    wrong here. A legitimate LAN media server that is simply powered off right
    now would become both un-testable and un-saveable, and an unrelated
    preference edit could be blocked by it. So a host that cannot be RESOLVED
    is NOT a policy denial — the runtime client re-validates before it ever
    connects. A host that positively resolves to (or literally is) a denied
    address still fails here.

    Args:
        url: an already scheme-checked base URL (scheme + netloc).

    Returns:
        ``None`` when the host is permitted, else an admin-safe explanation of

    added in bd-fbc50, re-pointed at the canonical mode-aware chokepoint by
    GH #754 / bead ``0yh70``). This is the single entry edge for every
    operator-typed base URL: the Dispatcharr / Emby / Plex / Jellyfin
    test-connection endpoints AND :func:`_validate_outbound_base_url_on_save`
    all route through it, so what an operator can prove works is exactly what
    they are allowed to store.

    1. Reject any scheme outside {http, https}. ``file://`` /
       ``gopher://`` / ``ftp://`` / etc. let an attacker pivot the
       proxy-server request through unintended protocols (file
       exfiltration, internal protocol smuggling).
    2. Reject when no hostname is present — without a hostname the
       client would either bind to a default loopback or raise late;
       fail-closed at the entry edge instead.
    3. Reconstruct the URL from scheme + netloc ONLY, stripping any
       path / params / query / fragment the operator typed (or an
       attacker tried to embed). The downstream client builds its own
       paths off the base URL — preserving the operator's path would
       let a crafted ``http://attacker.com/legit/path?bypass`` survive
       to the HTTP probe.
    4. Apply the mode-aware host policy via
       :func:`_host_denied_by_outbound_policy`. Loopback, RFC1918, and RFC 6598
       shared space follow ``ssrf_outbound_mode``; link-local / IMDS / ULA are denied in
       both modes.

    wholesale-config restore paths can persist the same field without any
    source-level assignment, and they are human-admin for that reason — and
    the mode decides which hosts every outbound path in ECM may reach. Leaving
    it writable by the principal that beads i4qrp / 9kwzp.6 / 9kwzp.7 refused
    on the outbound sinks made that control partial: the principal could not
    drive the probe but could move the fence it was measured against. The
