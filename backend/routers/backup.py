# restore paths still use). The new artifact is a ZIP containing:
#
#   manifest.json                 — schema_version (int) + app_version (str) +
#                                   created_at + per-file SHA-256 + redacted flag.
#                                   This is the CLEARTEXT HEADER: schema_version
#                                   is readable WITHOUT decrypting (encryption seam
#                                   for u81kh — a future wrapper encrypts the whole
#                                   ZIP file, but the schema_version must remain
#                                   discoverable from the manifest before decrypt).
#   categories/<name>.yaml        — per-category redacted config (reuses
#                                   build_yaml_export / _gather_* — single source).
#   journal.db                    — scrubbed via _scrub_journal_db_to_temp.
#   binary/metadata.json          — logo inventory.
#   binary/url-mappings.json      — logo-file -> source-URL map.
#   binary/logos/<file>           — per-image logo files (streamed, not buffered).
#
# A SHA-256 checksum SIDECAR file is written ALONGSIDE the ZIP (ADR-012 D1):
# ``<artifact>.sha256``, computed by STREAMING the finished ZIP file (never by

# ECM (schema_version > BACKUP_SCHEMA_VERSION) BEFORE any mutation — a v0.19
# archive restored on a v0.18 build would otherwise silently partial-restore
# and corrupt state. The rule (mirrors build_backup_artifact's contract):
# manifest schema_version <= BACKUP_SCHEMA_VERSION is accepted; anything newer
# (or missing/malformed) is refused.
#
# SECURITY (D1 + S4 — no schema-internals leakage): the user-facing message is
# EXACTLY "Unsupported backup version" with NO version numbers and NO schema
# internals. The actual detail (got X, support up to Y) is logged SERVER-SIDE
# only for operator troubleshooting.

# NOTE: the manifest ``schema_version`` and the embedded journal.db
# alembic_version are TWO DISTINCT axes. This gate is ONLY the manifest
# schema_version.

    upload cap bounds only the COMPRESSED bytes; a small high-ratio ZIP can still
    expand to gigabytes and OOM the single-process container. This guard iterates
    ``zf.infolist()`` (header metadata only — it never decompresses) and refuses

    Note: ``ZipInfo.file_size`` is the archive's own DECLARED uncompressed size and

    size, so refusing on the declared size stops the read before CPython would
    decompress to discover the real size. A liar that under-declares to slip past

    Takes ``{"filename": "ecm-backup-<ts>.zip", "confirm_apply": false,
    "passphrase": null}``, resolves the filename to its saved
    ``/config/backups/`` path through the strict regex + containment guard, then
    kicks :class:`tasks.dbas_restore.DbasRestoreTask` in the background (the SAME
    fire-and-forget pattern as POST /restore-dbas) and returns its ``task_id`` so
    the caller can poll ``/api/tasks/{task_id}`` for the terminal RestoreReport.

    This is the SAVED-file analogue of the upload-based POST /restore-dbas, and
    handles the v0.18.0 DBAS artifact format (incl. encrypted artifacts via
    ``passphrase``) — unlike the LEGACY POST /restore-saved, which only restores
    old-format ZIPs.

    DRY-RUN is default-ON: without ``confirm_apply=True`` the run is a counts-only
    plan that makes ZERO mutation. ``cleanup_artifact`` is DELIBERATELY False
    here — the artifact is the operator's SAVED backup, NOT a throwaway temp, so
    it MUST survive the restore.
