# were removed. Do NOT rename it, change its shape, or repurpose it. It is an INFORMATIONAL human-readable string ("which
# ECM build produced this artifact") — it is NOT a compatibility gate.

# The redaction placeholder. Defined once in the ``credential_sentinel`` leaf
# module so the restore side can recognize what this side wrote (bead …-6pilh):
# the DBAS importers strip it rather than writing it into a destination
# credential field, and ``credential_is_present`` refuses to read it as a
# configured credential. ``REDACTED`` is kept as the local name because the
# whole module (and the shipped artifact format) is written against it.
REDACTED = REDACTION_SENTINEL

# Fields in DispatcharrSettings that must never appear raw in an exported
# backup. Mirrors the YAML export contract for parity (bd-l0nhi).
# bd-jmi1c (GH #273): both ``dispatcharr_api_key`` (canonical) and the
# legacy ``api_key`` are listed so the back-compat mirror in
# ``config.save_settings`` doesn't accidentally leak a value the canonical
# redaction would have caught.
# Back-compat: drop 'api_key' from this tuple in v0.19.0 (bd-ewm4h) when
# the legacy field is removed from the model. The debug-bundle redactor in
# routers/channel_pipeline.py imports this tuple, so a single edit there
# propagates everywhere.
#
# READ-PARITY WITH GET /api/settings (bead …-9kwzp.9). The trailing entries share
# ``credential_sentinel.ADMIN_ONLY_READ_REDACTED_FIELDS`` with ``config`` rather
# than restating it. Bead 9ej7f made GET
# /api/settings withhold that partition from every caller
# ``routers.settings._resolve_settings_admin`` classifies as non-admin —
# including the MCP service principal. But GET /api/backup/create, /export and
# /saved/{filename} carry ``RequireAdminIfEnabled``, which ADMITS that
# principal (``_build_mcp_service_principal`` sets ``is_admin=True``), so while
# this tuple was a hand-maintained literal it silently defeated two thirds of
# 9ej7f: ``telegram_bot_token`` happened to be listed, ``discord_webhook_url``
# and ``telegram_chat_id`` were not, and neither is matched by
# ``_ALERT_METHOD_CREDENTIAL_KEYS`` (that set matches keys INSIDE
# ``alert_methods.config`` JSON, not top-level settings fields). The principal
# just refused those values on the settings endpoint read them out of a
# standard backup artifact instead.
#
# Adding two strings would have fixed the two fields and left the class open:
# every future addition to the settings read-redaction partition would leak the
# same way until someone remembered this second list. Deriving closes it — one
# edit in ``config`` now moves both surfaces. Do NOT re-inline these names.
# ``dict.fromkeys`` dedupes the overlap (``telegram_bot_token`` is in both
# halves) while keeping the historical order stable for the artifact contract.
#
# THIRD-PARTY BEARER CREDENTIALS THE EXACT-MATCH DENYLIST MISSED (bead …-gi4zn).
# ``_REDACT_KEYS`` matches key names EXACTLY, which is the right RUNTIME rule —
# a substring rule on "url" would rewrite the boolean ``show_stream_urls`` to a
# string sentinel. Its cost is that a newly added ``<vendor>_api_key`` ships in
# clear until someone remembers this list, and three of them had:
# ``emby_api_key`` and ``jellyfin_api_key`` are admin API keys for the
# operator's media server, and ``plex_token`` is a bearer credential for a Plex
# ACCOUNT. All three were exported verbatim in every standard artifact.
# ``smtp_user`` is the identity half of a pair whose secret half
# (``smtp_password``) was already listed — the same asymmetry the M3U username
# had. The class is closed by
# ``tests/routers/test_gi4zn_standard_artifact_full_redaction.py::
# test_no_credential_shaped_settings_field_is_left_unredacted``, which reads the
# live settings model, so the NEXT vendor field fails a required check rather
# than a drill.
_SETTINGS_CREDENTIAL_FIELDS: tuple[str, ...] = SETTINGS_CREDENTIAL_FIELDS

# Credential-class keys that may live inside alert_methods.config JSON. Matches
# the masking set in AlertMethod.to_dict (models.py) so backup redaction stays
# in lock-step with the API-response masking.
#
# CORRECTION (bead enhancedchannelmanager-9kwzp.13): this comment used to end
# "...the API-response masking ALREADY SHIPPED TO CLIENTS", and that clause was
# false when it was written. The masking existed on the model, but the two read
# routes in routers/alert_methods.py hand-rolled their response dicts and
# emitted alert_methods.config VERBATIM, so no API response was masked at all.
# The false claim is why the hole stayed invisible: a reader working out where
# alert credentials can leak got "the API already masks these" from here and
# stopped. Both read routes now serialize through
# AlertMethod.to_dict(include_sensitive=False), so the lock-step claim is true
# as written; if you ever make one of those handlers build its own dict again,
# this comment goes false again and this tuple is the thing that silently
# drifts.
_ALERT_METHOD_CREDENTIAL_KEYS = ALERT_METHOD_CREDENTIAL_KEYS

# The IDENTITY half of the same alert-method config blobs (bead …-gi4zn). An
# SMTP alert method stores ``username`` beside its ``password`` and a Telegram
# one stores ``chat_id`` beside its ``bot_token``; only the secret halves were
# scrubbed, so the standard artifact's journal.db carried the relay account name
# and the chat capability in clear. ``telegram_chat_id`` is already treated as a
# bearer capability at the SETTINGS level
# (``config.ADMIN_ONLY_READ_REDACTED_FIELDS``) — the identical value nested
# inside alert_methods.config was not, which is the same
# protected-beside-unprotected asymmetry the M3U username had.
#
# DELIBERATELY SEPARATE from :data:`_ALERT_METHOD_CREDENTIAL_KEYS` rather than
# appended to it, for two reasons. That tuple's docstring asserts lock-step with
# ``AlertMethod.to_dict``'s masking set, and that claim must stay literally true;
# changing the API-response masking is a different decision on a different
# surface. And it feeds :data:`_REDACT_KEYS`, which is matched against dict keys
# in EVERY category — a global ``chat_id`` entry would be scope this bead did not
# establish. These keys are therefore applied only where they were found
# leaking: the journal.db alert_methods scrub, and its restore-side merge-back.
_ALERT_METHOD_IDENTITY_KEYS = ("username", "chat_id")

# Every alert_methods.config key the backup scrubs and the restore merges back.
# One tuple so the two halves of that round-trip cannot drift: a key scrubbed on

_ALERT_METHOD_PROTECTED_KEYS = tuple(
    dict.fromkeys(_ALERT_METHOD_CREDENTIAL_KEYS + _ALERT_METHOD_IDENTITY_KEYS)
)

# journal.db tables holding ECM's OWN authentication and identity state, emptied
# out of the standard artifact (bead …-gi4zn, external security review findings
# A-1 / A-2). Until this landed, the scrub visited ``alert_methods`` and nothing
# else, so a standard artifact — the DEFAULT artifact, the one an operator
# attaches to a support ticket — handed over, read straight out of the archived
# ``journal.db`` with sqlite3:
#
#   * ``users.password_hash``   — the operator's own bcrypt admin hash, which is
#     offline-crackable at the attacker's leisure. ``password_hash`` was never in
#     :data:`_REDACT_KEYS` and no key denylist covers a DB COLUMN anyway.
#   * ``users.username`` / ``email`` — the account names to crack it against.
#   * ``user_sessions.refresh_token_hash`` / ``prior_refresh_token_hash`` — live
#     session material; ``ip_address`` / ``user_agent`` — forensic metadata about
#     where and with what the operator administers the instance.
#   * ``password_reset_tokens.token_hash`` — an account-recovery credential.
#   * ``user_identities.provider`` / ``external_id`` / ``identifier`` — the ECM
#     admin correlated to their OIDC / SAML / LDAP identity at a THIRD-PARTY IdP.
#     That is third-party identity, squarely inside this bead's own property, and
#     the sixth instance of the protected-secret-beside-unprotected-identity
#     asymmetry the rest of this bead removed.
#
# THE ROWS ARE DELETED, NOT MASKED, and that is a deliberate availability
# decision rather than a maximalist one. ECM's first-run setup keys on
# ``session.query(User).count() == 0`` (``auth/routes.py`` -> ``/auth/setup-
# required`` and ``/auth/setup``, surfaced by ``ProtectedRoute.tsx``). A users
# table left populated but stripped of usable ``password_hash`` values is
# therefore the ONE state that is both unauthenticatable AND ineligible for the
# setup wizard — a restored instance nobody can log into, which is a worse
# outcome than the leak. Empty, the shipped first-run path takes over and the
# operator creates a new admin. What the operator re-establishes on a
# fresh-instance restore is exactly: their ECM account(s). Everything else in the
# artifact restores unchanged.
#
# The DESTINATION's own accounts are never collateral: a restore into an instance
# that already has users re-asserts them over the artifact
# (:func:`_capture_existing_auth_rows` / :func:`_reassert_auth_rows_after_restore`),
# so an admin restoring a backup is not logged out of their own instance.
#
# The ENCRYPTED cred-carrying artifact (``include_credentials``) is unaffected —
# it returns before the scrub runs at all — so a migration still carries the
# operator's accounts and restores login without re-entry.
#
# Order is DELETE order: dependents before ``users``. SQLite does not enforce the
# FKs unless ``PRAGMA foreign_keys`` is on, but ordering it correctly means the
# purge does not depend on that pragma being off.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE STANDARD ARTIFACT'S journal.db TABLE ALLOWLIST (bead …-gi4zn, round 3)
#
# WHY THIS IS AN ALLOWLIST. Three review rounds each found more tables that
# should not ship, and each round fixed the tables it had found:
# ``alert_methods`` first, then :data:`_AUTH_IDENTITY_TABLES`, then
# ``session_telemetry`` (Emby / Plex / Jellyfin account names),
# ``unique_client_connections`` (viewer IPs and usernames) and
# ``m3u_digest_settings.email_recipients``. That is the same failure shape as
# ``_REDACT_KEYS`` matching key names exactly, which is why ``emby_api_key``
# shipped in cleartext: a denylist has to be COMPLETE, and it is maintained by
# people who keep discovering it isn't.
#
# So the direction is inverted. This dict enumerates what a standard artifact is
# ALLOWED to carry out of journal.db; :func:`_scrub_journal_db_in_place` DROPS
# every other table. A table added to the schema later ships NOTHING until
# someone deliberately permits it — absent by construction, not by remembering to
# add it to a removal list. Same make-it-impossible shape the project already
# uses for ``OperationLedger`` being the only writer of the operation counters.
#
# The measured cost of the old direction, from a real live database: it carried
# EIGHT tables that no current model declares at all — ``services``,
# ``health_checks``, ``incidents``, ``incident_updates``, ``maintenance_windows``,
# ``service_alert_rules``, ``service_alert_history`` (the removed pre-v0.13
# health-monitor subsystem, see docs/database_migrations.md) and
# ``popularity_rules`` (removed in v0.11.0-0005). ``services.health_endpoint`` is
# an operator URL and ``incidents.created_by`` / ``service_alert_history.
# acknowledged_by`` are account names. No denylist maintained by reading
# ``models.py`` could ever have seen them, because they are not in models.py.
#
# THE SELECTION RULE. A standard artifact is the redacted, shareable,
# disaster-recovery artifact, and for the LEGACY ``_create_backup_zip`` path it is
# the ONLY carrier of ECM's own configuration (that ZIP is settings.json +
# journal.db; it has no categories/*.yaml). So a table is permitted when it is
# CONFIGURATION the operator authored and a restore needs, and dropped when it is
# history, telemetry, transient workflow state, credential material, or anything
# whose contents are unbounded free text. The default is drop; each entry below
# is a decision with its reason attached.
#
# Values are the reason the table is permitted. Keep them specific — this dict is
# the documentation of record for what a shared artifact contains.

# SINGLE shared credential-key denylist for the DBAS artifact (0i2vt.7, ADR-012
# D1 redact-by-default). Used by the NON-BYPASSABLE deep redactor
# (_redact_credentials_deep) that runs over EVERY category — including
# Dispatcharr-sourced sections (M3U / EPG accounts), which the shipped YAML
# export does NOT scrub on its own.
#
# CORRECTION (bead …-6pilh, verified against Dispatcharr 0.28.2 source): this
# comment previously claimed Dispatcharr never returns the M3U password. It
# does. ``M3UAccountSerializer`` marks ``password`` ``write_only``, but its
# ``to_representation`` then RE-ADDS it (``data["password"] = instance.password
# or ""``) for any caller with ``user_level >= 10`` — which ECM always is. The
# value is stored and returned in CLEARTEXT; the SHA1-at-fetch note in
# docs/dispatcharr_api.md is about the SCHEDULES-DIRECT (EPG) password, which
# genuinely is write-only with no admin re-add, and does not transfer to M3U.
# So this redactor is not merely defense-in-depth for M3U accounts — it is the
# only thing keeping a live provider password out of the artifact. Correctness
# on the restore side is the matching half: dbas/importers strip the sentinel
# rather than writing it into the destination credential field.
#
# This union folds in the settings + alert-method denylists so there is exactly
# one list to maintain. Matched case-insensitively against dict keys.

    """Return every URL-shaped substring of ``value``, in the order they appear.

    Equivalent to the forward-matching regex this replaced — same substrings, in
    the same order — but linear rather than quadratic in ``len(value)``. Each
    ``://`` is located by a literal scan, the scheme is recovered by walking
    BACK over the scheme-legal run in front of it, and the URL body is taken
    only once a scheme is actually there. Equivalence was checked by
    differential fuzzing against the old pattern over 1,030,000 random strings
    drawn from a URL-flavoured alphabet, and is pinned shape-by-shape by
    ``tests/routers/test_gi4zn_standard_artifact_full_redaction.py::
    test_every_url_shape_the_scrub_caught_before_is_still_caught``.

    Three details carry that equivalence, and getting any of them wrong is a
    silent credential leak or a return to quadratic cost rather than a visible
    failure:

    * **Skip forward to the first ASCII LETTER of the run.** The old pattern's
      leftmost match began there, not at the run's first character, because RFC
      3986 — and :func:`urlsplit`, which decides the outcome downstream —
      require a scheme to start on a letter. ``1https://<username>:<password>@host``
      yielded ``https://<username>:<password>@host`` and was scrubbed. Anchoring
      at the run's first
      CHARACTER instead hands :func:`urlsplit` a scheme starting on a digit,
      gets an empty scheme back, and silently stops scrubbing that URL — a data
      leak traded for a linear scan.
    * **A scheme-less ``://`` hides nothing.**
      ``+://https://<username>:<password>@host`` has a ``://`` with no scheme in
      front of it, and the real URL sits INSIDE
      what a greedy body match from that first separator would swallow. So a
      separator that fails resumes the search one character later rather than
      past the body it would have taken.
    * **The body is only measured after the scheme is found.** Measuring it
      first would re-scan the same span at every failing separator, which is the
      quadratic behaviour this function exists to remove (``"://" * n``).

    Cost is O(len(value)): ``str.find`` advances monotonically, accepted bodies
    are disjoint by construction, and two separators can never share a scheme
    run because neither ``:`` nor ``/`` is scheme-legal.

    THE SHAPE THIS EXISTS FOR (bead …-msqf7, measured against a real Xtream Codes
    provider on 2026-08-20). Every one of the 1,409,363 stream URLs in that
    provider's playlist put the account's username and password in path
    segments — ``/live/<user>/<pass>/<id>.ts`` and the ``movie`` / ``series``
    variants — while the SAME provider authenticated its guide endpoint by query
    string. Neither the key-name denylist (a stream's key is ``url``) nor
    :func:`_url_carries_credentials` could see it, so the pair crossed to a sync
    destination intact, on every scheduled cycle, while the run reported that
    credentials had been stripped.

    WHY THIS IS NOT THE GUESSING THE OLD DOCSTRING REFUSED. It is still true that
    no GENERAL rule separates ``/live/u/p/1.ts`` from an ordinary path. This rule
    is not general: it compares each segment against the values the source
    instance ACTUALLY holds, raw and percent-decoded. A path is rewritten because
    it contains this operator's password, not because it looks like it might
    contain someone's.

    THE PASSWORD IS THE GATE, and that is the whole of the false-positive
    defence. A URL is only rewritten once one of its segments carries a known
    SECRET; only then is the IDENTITY half redacted alongside it. Without that
    gate an operator whose XC username happened to be a structural path word
    (``live``, ``movie``, ``news``) would have every URL on the instance mangled,
    including credential-free ones belonging to other providers. With it, a
    username collision can only occur inside a URL already proven to carry the
    password — where the address needs the operator's attention regardless, so
    the extra sentinel costs nothing.

    WHAT THE REPLICA GETS. The scheme, host, port, kind marker and stream id all
    survive; only the credential segments become the sentinel. Blanking the value
    instead would reproduce bead …-v7d37's outcome one layer down — a replica
    holding streams with nowhere to point and no record of where they pointed.

    * The value IS a credential-bearing URL (an M3U ``server_url``, an EPG

      it, leaves the field unset rather than writing a half-URL that silently
      fails to authenticate, and names the field in
      ``credential_reentry_details``.
    * The value CONTAINS one (a status message quoting a failed request). Only
      the URL substring is replaced, so the operator keeps the diagnostic.
    * The value carries a KNOWN credential in a PATH SEGMENT (an Xtream Codes

    This does NOT bypass redaction: redaction still runs over every key; only the
    explicitly-approved migration creds are preserved, and the artifact is then
    whole-passphrase-encrypted (the only context in which ``preserve_keys`` is
    ever non-empty — see :func:`build_backup_artifact`). Keys NOT in this set
    (and never approved — e.g. ``password_hash``, never in :data:`_REDACT_KEYS`)
    stay redacted regardless.

    ``scrub_credential_urls`` is the URL-rule counterpart of ``preserve_keys``
    and is set False on that SAME cred-carrying path: an encrypted migration
    artifact is the one artifact allowed to carry credentials, and a provider URL
    with its query-string credential intact is exactly what makes it restorable
    without re-entry. It is a separate parameter rather than derived from

    ``known_secrets`` / ``known_identities`` extend rule 3 to the one credential
    carrier neither a key name nor a URL's structure can reveal: a PATH SEGMENT

    payload with :func:`_collect_credential_values`, so the match is against what
    this instance actually holds rather than against a pattern. Both default to
    empty, which makes the rule a no-op — every caller that does not opt in keeps
    byte-identical behaviour. See
    :func:`_rewrite_known_credential_segments` for why the secret half gates the
    identity half.

       what ships: ECM's own account tables, third-party and viewer identity,

       deep-redaction and URL-credential rules
       (:func:`_scrub_permitted_table_cells`), because the property applies to
       the tables that are kept as much as to the ones that are dropped.

       JSON (bd-l0nhi: PR #163 began storing the SMTP password there, so the live
       DB cannot be zipped raw). A row whose config does not parse as a JSON
       OBJECT has its whole ``config`` value replaced with the sentinel — see

    whole-passphrase-encrypted and its entire value is that a migration restores
    every credential — including the operator's accounts — without re-entry. It

    set, so the cleartext-on-disk default copy is always scrubbed. NOTE: any

    A JSON cell is rewritten only when the redacted STRUCTURE differs from the

def _scrub_journal_db_in_place(tmp_path: Path) -> None:
    """Scrub a temp COPY of journal.db in place, or raise :class:`BackupScrubError`.

    FAILS CLOSED at every step (bead …-gi4zn, review finding A-3). Each of the
    three ``return tmp_path`` fallbacks this replaced shipped the raw database:
    an unopenable file, an unreadable table, and an unparseable
    ``alert_methods.config`` row. The reviewer proved the third by seeding a
    truncated blob and reading its SMTP secret out of a built artifact while
    valid rows in the SAME database were correctly redacted.

    The two decisions inside that fail-closed rule:

    * **A row whose ``config`` is not a JSON object loses the whole blob** to the
      sentinel, rather than being dropped. Dropping the row would delete the
      operator's alert method outright — its name, type and enabled flag are not
      credentials and the restore wants them — and it would do so invisibly,
      since nothing downstream can report a row that is not there. Replacing the
      blob keeps the row present and visibly needing re-entry, and it cannot ship
      a byte that was never parsed. The restore side treats a whole-blob
      sentinel the same way it treats a per-key one (see
      :func:`_merge_alert_method_creds_after_restore`), so a restore into an
      instance that still holds the real config repairs it.
    * **A missing table is not a failure.** A freshly bootstrapped database has
      no ``alert_methods`` and may predate the auth tables; nothing to scrub is
      not the same as a scrub that could not run. Failing to LIST the tables IS
      a failure, because then we do not know what is in there.

    THE TABLE PASS IS AN ALLOWLIST (bead …-gi4zn round 3). Every table that is
    not a key of :data:`_STANDARD_ARTIFACT_TABLES` is DROPPED, so a table added
    to the schema later carries nothing until someone permits it. Read that
    dict's comment for why the direction is inverted and for the per-table
    reasons. Three consequences worth stating here:

    * **DROP, not DELETE.** The property is "the artifact contains exactly the
      permitted tables", which is mechanically checkable; "the artifact contains
      these tables and they are empty" is not the same statement and does not
      close the class. ``init_db()`` recreates every model-declared table empty
      via ``Base.metadata.create_all`` before anything queries it, so a dropped
      table heals on restore — see the RESTORE BEHAVIOUR notes in
      ``tests/routers/test_gi4zn_standard_artifact_full_redaction.py``.
    * **``sqlite_%`` internal tables are neither dropped nor required to be
      permitted.** ``sqlite_sequence`` is SQLite's own AUTOINCREMENT bookkeeping,
      cannot be dropped, and holds table names and counters rather than data.
    * **VIEWS ARE LEFT ALONE, deliberately.** ``channel_watch_stats_v`` is a
      saved query over ``session_telemetry``, which this allowlist drops. A view
      whose backing table is missing is resolved LAZILY by SQLite, and nothing
      queries it between the restore and ``init_db()``'s ``create_all``, which
      puts the table back. Dropping the view instead would be permanent: it is
      created by an Alembic revision, and a restored database stamped at head
      re-runs no revisions, so nothing would ever recreate it.

    Kept tables are not merely trusted. Every string cell of every permitted
    table goes through :func:`_scrub_permitted_table_cells`, which applies the
    same JSON deep-redaction and URL-credential rules the YAML categories get.
    That is what makes the allowlist safe for tables like
    ``dummy_epg_profiles``, whose URL templates are operator free text.

    VACUUM at the end is load-bearing, not hygiene: SQLite's ``DELETE`` unlinks
    cells into the freelist and leaves their bytes in the page file, so a purged
    password hash is still recoverable with a substring scan of the shipped
    member. ``PRAGMA secure_delete`` zeroes freed content as it goes and the
    VACUUM rebuilds the file from live rows only. Pinned by the whole-archive
    decompressed byte scan in
    ``tests/routers/test_gi4zn_standard_artifact_full_redaction.py``, which reads
    the archived bytes rather than the query results and so fails if either is
    dropped.

# DBAS backup artifact builder (0i2vt.7)
#
# The NEW v0.18.0 DBAS artifact format. Distinct from the legacy
# ``_create_backup_zip`` above (which the shipped GET /create + POST /save +
# restore paths still use). The new artifact is a ZIP containing:
#
#   manifest.json                 — schema_version (int) + app_version (str) +
#                                   created_at + per-file SHA-256 + redacted flag.
#                                   This is the CLEARTEXT HEADER: schema_version
#                                   is readable WITHOUT decrypting (encryption seam
#                                   for u81kh — a future wrapper encrypts the whole
#                                   ZIP file, but the schema_version must remain
#                                   discoverable from the manifest before decrypt).
#   categories/<name>.yaml        — per-category redacted config (reuses
#                                   build_yaml_export / _gather_* — single source).
#   journal.db                    — scrubbed via _scrub_journal_db_to_temp.
#   binary/metadata.json          — logo inventory.
#   binary/url-mappings.json      — logo-file -> source-URL map.
#   binary/logos/<file>           — per-image logo files (streamed, not buffered).
#
# A SHA-256 checksum SIDECAR file is written ALONGSIDE the ZIP (ADR-012 D1):
# ``<artifact>.sha256``, computed by STREAMING the finished ZIP file (never by
# hashing an in-RAM blob). Redaction is a NON-BYPASSABLE pipeline stage that
# runs BEFORE any bytes enter the archive: there is no "ship plaintext" switch.

# §3.5 D2 / checklist 5): they are enforced by iterating zf.infolist() BEFORE any

class BackupArtifact:
    """Result of :func:`build_backup_artifact`.

    Attributes:
        zip_path: Path to the sealed (redacted) ZIP artifact on disk.
        sidecar_path: Path to the ``<zip>.sha256`` checksum sidecar.
        schema_version: The integer schema version stamped in the manifest.
        sha256: Hex SHA-256 of the final artifact bytes (== sidecar contents).
            For an encrypted artifact this is over the ENCRYPTED envelope bytes
            (the bytes actually on disk).
        file_count: Number of member files written into the ZIP.
        encrypted: True when the artifact is whole-passphrase-encrypted
            (ADR-012 D12 / u81kh); the manifest/schema_version then live INSIDE
            the ciphertext and only the envelope ``format_version`` is readable
            pre-decrypt.
        gathered_categories: How many ``RESTORABLE_SECTIONS`` categories this
            artifact gathered — the DENOMINATOR that makes
            ``degraded_categories`` a count of items rather than a boolean
            (bead …-fexq1). ``degraded_categories`` is always a subset of
            these, so ``gathered_categories - len(degraded_categories)`` is
            how many archived cleanly.
            :class:`tasks.dbas_backup.DbasBackupTask` reports the pair as the
            run's ``success_count`` / ``failed_count``; without it, a backup
            that archived fifteen categories and stubbed one reported
            "0 ok, 1 failed" — a real, restorable artifact described as a
            total loss in the Journal and the task-history row.
        degraded_categories: Sorted list of ``RESTORABLE_SECTIONS`` category
            keys whose Dispatcharr gather failed and were written into the
            artifact as a ``{"_warning": ...}`` stub instead of real data
            (enhancedchannelmanager-zt3kf). Empty when every category gathered
            cleanly. The caller (:class:`tasks.dbas_backup.DbasBackupTask`)
            uses this to report a degraded-but-built backup as a WARNING
            rather than a silent clean success. ``"logos"`` also appears here
            when the builder could not archive the image bytes of one or more
            Dispatcharr-hosted logos (bead …-xb58a): the category's YAML is
            intact, but the artifact is missing payload the operator expects it
            to carry, which is the same "gathered less than it should" shape.
        unarchived_logo_bytes: How many Dispatcharr-hosted logos went into the
            artifact WITHOUT their image bytes. Non-zero means a restore will
            report that many logo misses. Reported alongside
            ``degraded_categories`` so the count is visible, not just the fact.
        unresolved_epg_links: How many archived channels carry an ``epg_data_id``
            whose guide row the producer could not resolve to a ``tvg_id`` (bead
            …-dfkbn, PR review W2). Those links cannot be reattached on restore
            and will be named in ``epg_link_miss_details``. Deliberately
            INFORMATIONAL: a dangling FK is common and largely unactionable, so a
            non-zero value does NOT make the run a WARNING and does NOT join
            ``degraded_categories``, unlike a failed category fetch or missing
            logo bytes, which are ECM failing to gather what it could have.
        epg_index_truncated: True when the source guide read came back at the
            :data:`dbas.archive_keys.EPG_INDEX_MAX_ROWS` ceiling, so the tvg_id
            index may be incomplete. Reported DISTINCTLY from the count above
            because it is a different diagnosis with a different remedy: some of
            those links may be perfectly good references the read never saw.
        recordings_excluded_already_started: How many DVR recordings were NOT
            archived because they had already started or finished (bead
            …-ciabe). ADR-013 requires every exclusion to be VISIBLE, so this
            number exists to be read out to the operator together with the
            manual action — the media files sit on the source instance's disk
            and only the operator can copy them across. Like
            ``unresolved_epg_links`` it is INFORMATIONAL: a finished recording is
            a named technical impossibility, not ECM failing to gather what it
            could have, so it never sets ``failed_count`` and never joins
            ``degraded_categories``.
        recordings_excluded_regenerated_by_a_rule: How many upcoming recordings
            were NOT archived because a recurring rule owns them and the
            destination's own hourly maintainer recreates them from the
            ``dvr_rules`` category. Reported DISTINCTLY from the count above
            because it needs no operator action at all — nothing is lost — while
            the other one does.

    shared _SETTINGS_CREDENTIAL_FIELDS denylist before any byte is emitted.

    * ``categories`` — a mapping of ``<category-name>.yaml`` -> YAML text. Each
      restorable section is emitted as its own file so a future selective
      restore (Phase 2) can read one category without parsing the whole
      archive.
    * ``degraded`` — sorted list of category keys whose Dispatcharr gather
      produced a ``{"_warning": ...}`` stub instead of real data
      (enhancedchannelmanager-zt3kf). This function calls
      :func:`_gather_dispatcharr_sections` ONE KEY AT A TIME (below), so each
      category's stub-or-not outcome is independent by construction — the
      per-fetch isolation contract documented on
      :func:`_gather_dispatcharr_sections` is what makes that true for the
      MULTI-section ``/export?sections=...`` caller too, not just this
      one-key-per-call pattern.

      Detection has to recognize BOTH stub shapes
      :func:`_gather_dispatcharr_sections` can return for a requested
      dispatcharr-backed key: the per-fetch stub nested under the key itself
      (``{key: {"_warning": ...}}``, one failing endpoint) AND the
      total-client-unavailability stub, which is the WHOLE blob
      (``{"_warning": ...}``, no per-key nesting at all — there was no
      per-key attempt to isolate because the client itself was unusable
      before any fetch). PR #770 review: the first cut here only checked the
      nested shape, so ``get_client()`` returning falsy or raising —
      degrading EVERY requested dispatcharr category at once — silently
      produced an EMPTY ``degraded`` list and a clean-success TaskResult on
      the worst possible input. The un-nested shape is intentionally
      preserved on the wire (it is the long-standing artifact/export shape
      the restore-side decoder already tolerates —
      ``tests/dbas/test_restore_artifact_decode.py`` — so this is a
      DETECTION-side fix, not a producer-side format change).

    * ``unresolved_epg_links``: how many archived channels carry an
      ``epg_data_id`` whose guide row the producer could not resolve to a
      ``tvg_id`` (bead …-dfkbn, PR review W2). Counted HERE because this is the
      one place that holds the redacted channel records the artifact is about to

# Dispatcharr is ECM's source of truth for logos (PO decision, 2026-08-04): a
# logo uploaded through ECM's own Logo Manager is written to DISPATCHARR's
# ``/data/logos/``, and ECM's ``/config/uploads/logos/`` (what
# :func:`_gather_logo_binary_subtree` collects) is empty on a normal install.
# The backup therefore FETCHES those bytes from Dispatcharr at gather time, over
# the same API with the same key it already uses for every other category. Logos
# were the one category where ECM read the metadata and not the payload.
#
# Only Dispatcharr-HOSTED logos are fetched. A logo whose ``url`` is an absolute
# http(s) CDN address restores byte-identically from the archived URL alone
# (verified 10 of 10 in run 2026-08-04-run2), so archiving its bytes would be
# waste, and the restore keeps its URL re-create path for exactly those.
#
# Everything here FAILS SOFT. A logo whose bytes cannot be fetched, spooled, or
# safely named degrades to the pre-fix behaviour: it is a counted miss the
# restore reports honestly, never a failed backup.

# FLAT ceiling on the logo bytes ONE artifact may fetch. This is only the LAST
# of the three limits :func:`_logo_byte_budget` applies; the binding ones are

        source_logos: The SOURCE Dispatcharr logo rows from

            already owns the listing's client lifetime, and ``get_client()``
            reads settings and can throw. ``None`` means every hosted logo is
            reported unarchived.
        spool_dir: A caller-owned temp dir for the fetched payloads. The caller
            removes it after the ZIP is sealed.
        taken_filenames: Binary-subtree filenames already claimed (the on-disk
            logos :func:`_gather_logo_binary_subtree` collected). Mutated: each
            filename this function claims is added.

            restore-side cumulative cap (see :func:`_logo_byte_budget`).

# bead 9kwzp.10 item 2 (PR #855 review) — the DBAS APPLY carve-out.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The MCP service principal is refused the DBAS restore because bead …-dfkbn
# item 4 added ``dbas/importers/ecm_settings.py`` and the restore now writes
# ECM's own settings blob wholesale, which is the kgz3k bypass bead 6n76m
# closed on the three legacy /restore* endpoints. That reasoning covers the
# APPLY. It does not cover the PREVIEW, and the two DBAS routes are NOT
# symmetric, so they are gated differently on purpose:
#
# * ``POST /restore-dbas`` takes a caller-supplied UPLOAD. The artifact is
#   streamed to the config partition (up to 2 GiB) and decoded before anything
#   examines ``confirm_apply``, so even a dry run hands this principal a parser
#   and a disk-consumption surface with an artifact of its own choosing. The
#   sidecar exposes no tool for it either (there is no file upload over MCP),
#   so a blanket denial removes no capability. It keeps
#   ``RequireHumanAdminIfEnabled``.
#
# * ``POST /restore-dbas-saved`` names an artifact ALREADY on the server, which
#   only an admin could have put there (``POST /api/backup/save`` and the saved
#   listing are both admin-gated). There is no attacker-supplied artifact on
#   this path, and the sidecar's ``restore_dbas_backup_saved`` tool documents
#   ``confirm_apply=False`` as its primary safe mode: a counts-only preview.
#   ``dbas.restore_orchestrator`` forces ``report.is_dry_run = True`` whenever
#   ``confirm_apply`` is false and treats that as the single choke point a
#   caller can never opt out of, so the zero-mutation claim is structural
#   rather than a flag we trust. Refusing it would have been an unrelated,
#   undocumented capability removal, so the refusal is conditional instead.
#
# The conditional half is enforced in the HANDLER rather than in the route
# dependency, following the kgz3k precedent in ``routers/settings.py``
# (``_resolve_settings_admin`` resolves a bool; ``_assert_admin_for_changed_
# fields`` raises on the specific attempt). A dependency cannot see
# ``confirm_apply`` here without consuming the request body first.
# ``tests/test_admin_gate_inventory.py`` records the route under
# ``_DBAS_PREVIEW_ADMITTED_APPLY_DENIED_IN_HANDLER`` so the split is not
# invisible to the inventory.

    "The MCP service principal cannot APPLY a DBAS restore. Applying rewrites "

    bead 9kwzp.10 item 2: moved off the PLAIN admin tier onto the same gate the
    three legacy ``/restore*`` endpoints have carried since bead 6n76m. The
    plain tier was CORRECT when it was written, and the history says so in
    three commits:

    * ``21f93e683`` (2026-06-19) shipped this endpoint with the plain admin
      tier. At that point a DBAS restore applied denylist-filtered settings to
      the DISPATCHARR upstream and never touched ECM's own ``settings.json``.
    * ``e83d31b1`` (2026-07-08, bead 6n76m) human-gated the legacy ``/restore``,
      ``/restore-saved`` and ``/restore-yaml`` paths, which already DID write
      ECM's settings blob, and deliberately left DBAS on the plain tier for
      exactly the distinction above.
    * ``fd63235d`` (2026-08-04, bead …-dfkbn item 4) added
      ``dbas/importers/ecm_settings.py``: a generic ``setattr`` loop over the
      archive's settings mapping followed by ``save_settings``. That is what
      made the distinction stale.

    The importer excludes only the live Dispatcharr connection, install-local
    bookkeeping and redaction sentinels — NOT ``emby_base_url`` /
    ``plex_base_url`` / ``jellyfin_base_url``, the notification credentials,
    the GH #473 safety caps or ``ssrf_outbound_mode``. So a caller supplying
    its own artifact could set every admin-only field the kgz3k field-level
    gate on POST /api/settings refuses it, which is the bypass 6n76m closed on
    the other three endpoints. The gate went stale when the capability grew
    rather than being wrong when it was written. It no-ops while
    ``require_auth`` is false or setup is incomplete, as it already did for the
    legacy trio.

    THE DENIAL HERE IS BLANKET, INCLUDING THE DRY RUN, and that is deliberate
    rather than an oversight: this route takes a caller-supplied UPLOAD, which
    is streamed to the config partition and decoded before anything examines
    ``confirm_apply``, so even a preview hands the principal a parser and a
    disk-consumption surface with an artifact of its own choosing. The sidecar
    exposes no tool for it (there is no file upload over MCP), so nothing is
    lost. Its saved-artifact sibling :func:`restore_dbas_saved` IS split by
    ``confirm_apply``, because there the artifact was already put on disk by an
    admin; see the comment above ``_DBAS_APPLY_MCP_DENIAL``.

    Streams the uploaded artifact to a temp file on the CONFIG partition, then
    kicks the :class:`tasks.dbas_restore.DbasRestoreTask` in the background and
    returns its ``task_id`` so the frontend can poll ``/api/tasks/{task_id}`` for
    per-stage progress and the terminal ``RestoreReport``.

    DRY-RUN is default-ON: without ``confirm_apply=True`` the run is a counts-only
    plan that makes ZERO mutation (the orchestrator's .16 guardrail enforces this
    even if this flag were bypassed). Validation (.17 version + integrity) runs
    inside the task BEFORE any decode or importer.

    ``routers.settings._resolve_settings_admin`` — the MCP service principal —
    cannot read out of an artifact what the settings endpoint withholds
    (bead …-9kwzp.9).

    ``include_credentials`` (ADR-012 D12 / u81kh) preserves the settings-class
    credentials (SMTP password, API keys, bot tokens) instead of redacting them,
    for the opt-in passphrase-encrypted cred-carrying migration path. It is only
    ever True inside :func:`build_backup_artifact` when a passphrase is set; the
    review/portability YAML export path always redacts.

    THE NAME MASK IS NOT SUFFICIENT ON ITS OWN (bead …-04c0u.13 review). It
    matches FIELD NAMES, so a credential riding inside a URL VALUE under a name
    no denylist covers went out in clear: ``url`` (the Dispatcharr address, whose
    authority component accepts RFC 3986 userinfo), and equally ``emby_base_url`` /
    ``jellyfin_base_url`` / ``plex_base_url`` / ``public_base_url``, any of which

    already ran :func:`_redact_credentials_deep` — and therefore
    :func:`_scrub_credential_urls` — over its copy of this dict, so the LEGACY
    ZIP producer (:func:`_create_backup_zip`) was the only caller reaching an
    archive without it. Applying it here closes that one gap at the source rather
    than at one producer, and is idempotent for the YAML path.

    Restore is unaffected for the shape that matters:
    :func:`_scrub_credential_urls` returns the WHOLE-VALUE sentinel when the
    value IS the credential-bearing URL, which is the shape of every settings
    field above, and :func:`_merge_settings_preserving_redacted` skips exactly
    that value — so a restore keeps the working on-disk address instead of
    overwriting it with a half-URL. Pinned by

    it is still readable: at backup time, against the source instance.

    Returns a dict keyed by section name with full data suitable for restore.
    Only fetches sections that are in the selected set.

    Isolation contract (routed finding from lsa0s, enhancedchannelmanager-zt3kf):
    each requested section's upstream fetch is wrapped in ITS OWN try/except —
    a failure fetching one section (e.g. ``get_epg_sources()`` raises) degrades
    ONLY that section's value to ``{"_warning": ...}`` and never prevents the
    OTHER sections requested in the SAME call from being fetched normally. This
    is an explicit per-fetch contract, not an accident of a caller happening to
    invoke this function once per category — the artifact builder
    (:func:`_gather_redacted_categories`) does call it that way today, but a
    direct multi-section call (``build_yaml_export({"epg_sources",
    "m3u_accounts"})`` via the legacy ``/export?sections=...`` path) gets the
    SAME per-section isolation, not a shared blast radius.

    The one case that is deliberately NOT per-section is total client
    unavailability: when ``get_client()`` returns falsy (or raises) BEFORE any
    per-section fetch is attempted, every requested section is equally
    unreachable — there is nothing section-specific to isolate — so the whole
    Dispatcharr-managed blob degrades together under a single top-level

    """Build a YAML export string, optionally limited to specific sections.

    If sections is None, all sections are included. Otherwise only the
    specified section keys (from RESTORABLE_SECTIONS) are included.

    ``include_credentials`` (ADR-012 D12 / u81kh) flows down to
    :func:`_gather_settings` to preserve settings-class creds for the opt-in
    passphrase-encrypted migration path; it is only ever True from
    :func:`build_backup_artifact`. The user-facing ``/export`` endpoint never
    sets it (always redacts).

    WHY THE DEEP REDACTOR RUNS HERE and not only in the artifact builder (bead
    …-gi4zn). This function is the shared gather for TWO operator-shareable
    artifacts: the DBAS artifact (via :func:`_gather_redacted_categories`) and
    the legacy ``GET /api/backup/export`` YAML. Only the first passed its
    payload through :func:`_redact_credentials_deep`, so the second scrubbed
    settings-class fields and nothing else — a Dispatcharr-sourced M3U or EPG
    record went out with whatever the upstream returned. Redacting at the gather
    makes ONE authority cover both surfaces; the artifact builder still runs the
    deep redactor afterwards (idempotent: a sentinel re-redacts to itself) so its
    NON-BYPASSABLE-stage property is unchanged even if a future caller reaches
    the gather another way.

    ``exempt_identity_keys`` names the provider-identity keys this particular
    gather must NOT redact — see :data:`_IDENTITY_EXEMPT_CATEGORIES`. Defaulting
    to empty means a caller that says nothing gets full redaction.

    The default set (``sections=None``) excludes ``artifact_only`` categories
    (channels / dispatcharr_users — 7i8rf): those are restorable only via the
    DBAS artifact path, not the legacy YAML export/restore, so the user-facing
    full YAML export keeps its pre-7i8rf shape. The artifact builder
    (:func:`_gather_redacted_categories`) requests each category by its EXPLICIT
    key, so it still emits the artifact_only producers.

    Admin required. The MCP service principal is admitted for the counts-only

    bead 9kwzp.10 item 2, as revised by the PR #855 review. The APPLY half is
    refused for the reason :func:`restore_dbas_artifact` records: bead …-dfkbn
    item 4 taught the DBAS restore to write ECM's own ``settings.json``, which
    is the kgz3k bypass bead 6n76m closed on the legacy ``/restore*`` trio. The
    PREVIEW half is NOT, because that reasoning does not reach a run that
    writes nothing: ``dbas.restore_orchestrator`` forces
    ``report.is_dry_run = True`` whenever ``confirm_apply`` is false, as the
    single choke point a caller can never opt out of. This route also names an
    artifact ALREADY on the server, which only an admin could have saved there,
    so nothing here is caller-supplied except the filename. Blanket-denying it
    would have removed the documented safe mode of the sidecar's
    ``restore_dbas_backup_saved`` tool as an unremarked side effect.

    The upload sibling ``POST /restore-dbas`` is deliberately NOT split this
    way; see the module-level comment above ``_DBAS_APPLY_MCP_DENIAL``.


    Takes ``{"filename": "ecm-backup-<ts>.zip", "confirm_apply": false,
    "passphrase": null}``, resolves the filename to its saved
    ``/config/backups/`` path through the strict regex + containment guard, then
    kicks :class:`tasks.dbas_restore.DbasRestoreTask` in the background (the SAME
    fire-and-forget pattern as POST /restore-dbas) and returns its ``task_id`` so
    the caller can poll ``/api/tasks/{task_id}`` for the terminal RestoreReport.

    This is the SAVED-file analogue of the upload-based POST /restore-dbas, and
    handles the v0.18.0 DBAS artifact format (incl. encrypted artifacts via
    ``passphrase``) — unlike the LEGACY POST /restore-saved, which only restores
    old-format ZIPs.

    DRY-RUN is default-ON: without ``confirm_apply=True`` the run is a counts-only
    plan that makes ZERO mutation. ``cleanup_artifact`` is DELIBERATELY False
    here — the artifact is the operator's SAVED backup, NOT a throwaway temp, so
    it MUST survive the restore.
