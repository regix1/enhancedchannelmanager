    """Enforced-global save (GH #720 Part B / PO decision). Finding 3: the
    PRIMARY account PATCH and the sibling cascade are performed while holding the
    changed groups' per-effective-group locks (shared with reconcile + normalize,
    acquired in sorted order), so two concurrent SAME-PROCESS opposing saves
    serialize to last-writer-wins.

    HONEST GUARANTEE: the sibling cascade is a SEQUENCE of independent remote
    PATCHes, NOT a single atomic transaction. Serialization is IN-PROCESS only;
    cross-process concurrent saves are out of scope (bead nq3ed).

    CLEAR ORDERING (Round-9, DBA proposal — closes the resurrect WITHOUT
    tombstones): when a genuine CLEAR is present (a group whose selection went
    present -> empty), the AUTHORITATIVE PRIMARY is cleared LAST — siblings are
    cleared FIRST (from a fresh-under-lock account read that must be non-empty and
    contain the primary, else fail closed), and if ANY sibling clear fails we
    ABORT BEFORE clearing the primary. So the PRIMARY is NEVER cleared on a
    failure — no primary-cleared + stale-sibling state the collapse winner could
    re-elect and RESURRECT. NOTE the abort is NOT all-or-nothing: an earlier
    sibling may already have been cleared before a later one failed. That partial
    mutation is reported truthfully (503 naming cleared + failed accounts) and the
    cleared siblings are JOURNALED; the primary still carries the selection, so
    the next normalize sweep re-fills those cleared siblings from it, self-healing
    back to the prior selection until the operator re-saves.

    Returns ``(primary_result, propagation_error, applied, changed_siblings)``.
    ``applied`` is False when a clear was ABORTED before the primary write (the
    primary keeps its selection). ``changed_siblings`` are the sibling accounts
    whose row WAS mutated before the abort — the caller journals them and reports
    the truthful partial (finding 4), never "no write" when a sibling changed."""

    The Event Sync rule editor's pre-flight surfaces a misconfigured group —
    master with auto-sync OFF, or a secondary with it ON — and offers a
    one-click fix that lands here. Hard constraints (security, locked at
    planning):

    * **Explicit, separately confirmed operator action.** ``confirm: true``
      is required — the UI sends it only from its own confirmation dialog
      stating exactly what will change and why. This endpoint is NEVER
      called as a side effect of saving a rule or running the pipeline; it
      is deliberately OUTSIDE the event_sync feature modules, whose AST
      no-group-writes gate (tests/unit/test_event_sync_rollback_roundtrip
      .py) keeps proving the attach/preview path never writes group
      settings.
    * **Admin-gated** (``RequireAdminIfEnabled``) — same tier as the other
      duplicate-channel-risk toggles.
    * **Journaled per toggle** (the allow_multi_provider_auto_sync
      guard-change journaling in routers/settings.py is the precedent):
      snapshot restore does NOT revert Dispatcharr group settings, so the
      journal entry is the operator's recovery breadcrumb.

    Both directions are supported: enable (master group) and disable
    (secondary group). A no-op request (already at the requested value)
    returns ``changed: false`` and writes nothing — not even a journal
    entry.
