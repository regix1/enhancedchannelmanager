"""The redaction sentinel and its consumer-side predicates (bead ``…-6pilh``).

Cross-cutting utility (``docs/style_guide.md`` — "cross-cutting utilities at top
level"): a leaf module with no ECM imports, so both the artifact PRODUCER
(``routers.backup``) and the restore CONSUMERS (``dbas.importers.*``,
``config``) can share one definition without an import cycle.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------

The DBAS backup pipeline is redact-by-default: every credential-class value is
replaced with :data:`REDACTION_SENTINEL` before a byte enters the archive
(``routers.backup._redact_credentials_deep``). That is correct. What was missing
was the other half of the contract — the restore side had no way to RECOGNIZE
the placeholder, so it wrote the literal string straight into the destination's
credential field.

The failure mode that produced this module: a restored Xtream-Codes M3U account
whose ``password`` was the 14-character string ``***REDACTED***``. It presents
as fully configured — the UI shows a populated field and every truthiness-based
"is a credential present?" probe returns True — and then fails at the provider
with a 512, materializing zero streams. That is strictly WORSE than an empty
password, which is visibly incomplete and prompts the operator to act.

THE TWO RULES
-------------

1. **Never write the sentinel into a destination field.** Strip it and leave the
   credential unset (:func:`strip_redaction_sentinels`).
2. **Never let a presence check be fooled by it.** A value ECM itself wrote as a
   placeholder is ABSENT, not present (:func:`credential_is_present`).

Detection is by VALUE, not by key name. A key-name denylist has to be kept in
sync with every producer; "this exact string is our own placeholder" is true
regardless of which field carries it, including keys nested inside
``custom_properties`` blobs.
