    must go through this function rather than

    * the FastAPI startup handler (``main.py``) — an exception out of a startup

    * ``main.auth_middleware`` — runs on every non-exempt request;
    * ``auth.dependencies._is_mcp_service_token``, called by

      request on a dependency-guarded route.

    ``/api/health`` — exempt from auth, and what the container ``HEALTHCHECK``
    probes — still reports healthy (bead enhancedchannelmanager-04c0u.8).

    sidecar principal has no credential, so the middleware's MCP branch is
    simply never entered and an MCP-authenticated request falls through to the
    ordinary 401 — fail-closed. ``backend/entrypoint.sh`` prepares the
    projection directory while it is still root, so reaching ``None`` in
    production means the mount changed underneath a running container.
