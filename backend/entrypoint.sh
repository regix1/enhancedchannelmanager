# --- Interpreter resolution (bead enhancedchannelmanager-0oi96) ------------
# ECM's dependencies live in the image virtualenv at /opt/venv, which the
# Dockerfile puts on PATH. Resolving `python3`/`uvicorn` through PATH made
# every check below silently follow an operator-side PATH override (or a
# bind mount shadowing /opt/venv) down to the Debian system interpreter —
# which reports a reassuring "Python 3.12.13" while having none of ECM's
# packages. Field symptom on 0.18.0: "✗ Required Python packages missing"
# followed by ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'.
#
# So resolve both binaries ONCE, here, pinned to absolute venv paths, and
# use those everywhere. Both stay overridable (custom images may put the
# venv elsewhere) and both fall back to a PATH lookup if the pinned path is
# not executable, so an image without /opt/venv behaves as it did before.
#
# The [ ! -x ] fallbacks below cannot tell "the default pin is absent, fall
# back" from "the operator set this explicitly and typo'd it, fall back
# wrongly" (bead enhancedchannelmanager-wpzo6). Capture the override BEFORE
# the default expansion erases the distinction, so check_python can say which
# one happened — a discarded override that resolves something else silently
# hands the operator back the same diagnostics that sent them here.
