                a hand-built MANUAL channel (``auto_created`` missing/falsy) as a
                merge/update/rename target on a name collision — the manual
                channel is treated as "not found" and a new auto channel is
                created instead. When True, the rule opts back into the legacy
                behavior and may adopt manual channels (the adoption is
                journaled). Threaded into the resolution chokepoint as
                ``block_manual = not allow_manual_channel_merge``.
            fold_match_key: When True (GH #645 / bead 0vao3 — opt-in per
                rule, default False), the create_channel ``if_exists`` merge
                lookup additionally compares names by the shared canonical
                fold key (casefold + strip ALL whitespace) so whitespace/case
                spelling variants merge into one channel instead of creating
                duplicates. Comparison key only — stored channel names are
                never altered. Threaded into ``_find_channel_by_name`` as
                ``fold_key``.

        ``rule_id`` (GH #720 Part B handoff) is threaded into the per-channel
        ownership marker exactly as the standard path does, so event_sync-owned
        channels are released when the owning rule is disabled/deleted.

        The standard Pass 1/2 path runs ``assign_channel_profile`` per matched
        stream against ``exec_ctx.current_channel_id``. event_sync rules do NOT
        flow through per-stream action evaluation — the dedicated attach phase
        (:meth:`execute_event_sync_rule`) resolves and attaches streams
        directly — so a configured ``assign_channel_profile`` on an event_sync
        rule never fired before. This helper closes that gap WITHOUT routing
        event_sync through the standard passes: the engine hands it the channels
        the rule touched this run (newly-attached masters + promoted channels)
        and it applies exclusive membership to each.

        It reuses :meth:`_execute_assign_channel_profile` unchanged by rebinding
        ``exec_ctx.current_channel_id`` per channel, so the truthful-status,
        exclusive-membership, universe-availability, and modified-flag semantics
        are BYTE-IDENTICAL to the standard path. Each result funnels through the
        shared ``add_result`` chokepoint exactly as the standard path's
        ``execute`` does, so channels_updated / modified_entities stay
        consistent. A dummy StreamContext is passed because

        Dispatcharr auto-joins every newly-created channel to ALL channel
        profiles, so honoring a profile selection is SUBTRACTIVE: for each
        profile id in the FULL known universe, enable it if selected and
        disable it otherwise.

        Returns a :class:`ProfileMembershipResult` carrying the SUCCEEDED
        enable/disable counts AND ``failed_profile_ids`` — the ids of any
        profile whose update raised. Callers inspect ``failed_profile_ids`` to
        detect incomplete exclusivity: a per-profile failure is logged and
        SKIPPED (best-effort continuation — one bad update must not abort the
        rest) but is NOT swallowed, so the caller can report a non-success and
        the incomplete reconciliation stays observable/retryable (GH #720 /
        y3m6o.1).

        The iteration order is the de-duplicated union of the known profile
        universe and the selection, so selected profiles are always enabled —
        even if the fetched profile list is stale and missing one — while every
        OTHER known profile is disabled.

        **Diff-only writes (y3m6o.1 review follow-up).** Only the profiles whose
        enabled-state actually FLIPS are PATCHed: current membership (from the
        run-start ``get_channel_profiles()`` snapshot, plus the verified
        Dispatcharr rule that a channel created THIS run is auto-joined to ALL
        universe profiles) is diffed against the desired exclusive set, and a
        profile already in the desired state is skipped. A fully-idempotent
        reconcile therefore performs ZERO writes and returns ``changed=False``,
        so re-running a rule no longer inflates ``channels_updated``. The
        in-memory membership map is updated after each successful flip so a
        second reconcile of the same channel this run sees fresh state.

        A ``None`` ``self._all_profile_ids`` (universe unavailable) is coerced
        to an empty universe HERE only defensively: callers that require a
        known universe to prove exclusivity (``_execute_assign_channel_profile``)
        gate on availability BEFORE calling this helper, and
        ``_assign_default_profiles`` returns early on a falsy universe — so this
        helper is never reached with ``None`` in practice.

        construction). This method adds NO policy of its own: it only builds
        the master name universe and the name → channel-id map.

        Candidates are exclusively the master group's channels (tighter
        scoping than the scored-fuzzy allowlist — the mandatory-scoping
        rail). Master channels come from ``self.existing_channels`` — loaded
        ONCE per run by the engine and indexed in ``self._channel_by_id`` —
        so there is no per-stream (or even per-rule) refetch. Duplicate
        master names map to the LOWEST channel id, mirroring the preview
        endpoint exactly (stateless recompute: ids are re-resolved from the
        in-run channel list every run, never persisted).

        * ``would_attach`` → attach via the EXISTING add-stream-to-channel
          merge internals (:meth:`_add_stream_to_channel`). Idempotent by
          construction: a stream already on the master channel is a no-op
          skip, so stateless re-runs after every refresh are safe. The
          journal provenance carries ``attach_source`` ("threshold" vs
          "review_queue") so queue-driven attaches — dispositions upgraded
          by a prior operator accept — stay distinguishable (ti939.3.2).
        * ``ambiguous`` (band or contested rail) → skip + count, AND
          surface the enqueue-eligible pairings in
          ``summary["review_candidates"]`` (fingerprint + evidence
          payloads). The ENGINE persists them on live runs — this method
          stays DB-free, and a dry run therefore enqueues nothing by
          construction.
        * ``unmatched`` / ``parse_failed`` → skip with reason (counted).
          Pairings the operator previously REJECTED are already filtered
          inside the resolver (counted via ``rejected_suppressed``).
        * ``excluded_by_operator`` (bead ti939.3.5) → skip + count. The
          resolver already removed the excluded pairing(s) BEFORE the
          attach band was honored; this disposition marks a stream whose
          only viable pairing was an operator "never attach". Suppression
          on streams that still attach/queue elsewhere is counted via
          ``excluded_suppressed``.

        Blast-radius controls:

        * Per-run attach cap (``config["max_attach_per_run"]``): on overage
          this stops attaching (WARNs; the engine also writes an execution
          log entry + run warning from the returned summary) and records the
          overage count. Live runs only — a dry run mutates nothing, and
          capping it would hide the run's true would-attach size. Idempotent
          already-attached no-ops never consume cap budget.
        * Journal entry per attach: category "event_sync",
          batch_id = execution id, with NAMES alongside IDs (secondary
          stream name+id, provider, master channel name+id) plus score,
          band, time delta and team-token verdict — via the provenance dict
          threaded into ``_add_stream_to_channel``.
        * NEVER creates or deletes channels; never touches
          managed_channel_ids; never toggles Dispatcharr group settings.

        Returns a summary dict the engine folds into the execution record:
        counts per disposition, cap state, and per-attach ``attach_entries``

        """Promote unmatched secondary-only events to ECM-managed channels
        (bead ti939.4.1 — the ONE sanctioned channel-creation exception).

        The PLAN comes from ``services.event_sync_promote
        .build_promotion_plan`` — the same pure helper the preview endpoint
        calls over the same resolver output, so preview and live promotion
        cannot diverge on identical inputs. This method only REALIZES the
        plan:

        * **Create-or-adopt** per unit via a constructed
          ``Action(type="create_channel", if_exists="skip")`` through
          :meth:`_execute_create_channel`'s existing group-scoped duplicate
          lookup (``match_scope_target_group``). ``allow_manual_channel_merge``
          is True: a previously-promoted channel reads as "manual" on later
          runs (Dispatcharr does not persist ECM's in-run auto_created
          marker), and adopting it by name IS the idempotence mechanism —
          the promotion target group is documented ECM-owned space.
          That lookup, not the plan's ``action``, is what decides create
          versus adopt, so its index and the plan's map have to strip the
          same channel-number prefix or the two disagree and the run
          creates a duplicate. Both take the separator from
          ``self._channel_number_separator``. [44]
        * **Attach** every unit stream via :meth:`_add_stream_to_channel`
          with provenance ``kind="event_sync_promote"`` (content fingerprint
          + names; IDs display-only) under journal category ``event_sync``.
          The stream embedded in a CREATE call is journaled explicitly with
          the same provenance so every attached stream has its journal row.
        * **Cap**: only units the plan marked realizable run; capped units
          are counted (the engine surfaces the warning). Adoption never
          consumes cap budget.
        * **Past events**: with ``skip_past_events`` on, the plan has
          already dropped every finished event's unit (counted as
          ``skipped_past``, of which ``skipped_past_adopted`` already have
          a channel). Nothing here deletes anything: a dropped adopt unit
          simply never reaches ``channel_ids``, so the channel is absent
          from the managed set this method returns and Pass 4 applies the
          rule's own ``orphan_action`` to it. Subtraction is the whole
          mechanism — there is deliberately no delete call on this path.
        * **Lead time**: with ``promote_lead_hours`` set, an event further
          ahead than the window is not created yet (counted as
          ``skipped_early``). It gates CREATES ONLY — an event that already
          has a channel keeps it however far away it is, because
          un-promoting it would delete and recreate the same channel every
          day until the window opened.
        * **Dateless events**: an event whose name carries a time but no
          date is never promoted (counted as ``skipped_dateless``). Like
          the health filter this retires nothing — a channel an earlier
          run already made for such an event keeps its place.
        * **Stream health**: with ``skip_dead_streams`` on, the streams
          this run is about to turn into channels are health-checked and
          the failures leave their unit's attach list
          (``dead_streams_skipped``). A unit with no working stream left is
          not realized (``skipped_all_dead``) — but its EXISTING channel,
          if it has one, still joins ``channel_ids``, so a provider having
          a bad hour can never make Pass 4 delete an operator's channel.
          Health blocks creates and attaches; it never retires anything.
          The check runs LAST, on the plan's post-cap units only: probing
          dials the provider, so it sees the handful of streams that
          survived the past filter, the lead window and the cap rather
          than every parsed candidate. Two inputs come from here: the
          provider's own ``is_stale`` flag, carried off the fetch the run
          already made, and which events have already started, since a
          probe failure before kickoff can just mean there is nothing to
          serve yet.
        * **Delisted streams leave a channel that got a working
          replacement**: this provider re-lists each event under a new id
          on every refresh, so an adopted channel otherwise keeps every id
          it has ever been given. A stale id is removed through the
          standard ``remove_from_channel`` execution, which records the
          channel's previous stream list for rollback and mutates nothing
          on a dry run, and ONLY where it belongs to the same unit as a
          stream on that channel whose probe PASSED
          (``stale_streams_removed``). Another event sharing the channel
          keeps its own streams: its evidence is its own.
          Attaching needs a stream that is not dead; detaching needs one
          that is proven to work, which is a higher bar on purpose. Before
          kickoff a replacement often fails its probe because there is
          nothing to serve yet, and the delisted stream is usually the only
          thing still serving the event, so where nothing has a passing
          verdict the channel keeps BOTH streams and keeps playing.

        create/adopt lookup is scoped to the promotion target group, so a
        master-group channel is unreachable by construction; the engine
        re-asserts this invariant when registering).

        this rides the EXISTING machinery end to end: each channel without
        guide data gets a standard ``assign_epg`` execution against the
        Dispatcharr EPG source that serves the profile's XMLTV
        (``/api/dummy-epg/xmltv/<profile_id>``); a channel the source does
        not cover yet (brand-new event, or first run) defers into
        ``_deferred_epg_assignments`` and the EXISTING Pass 5 refresh-and-
        retry — which also auto-adds the master group to the profile's
        ``channel_group_ids``, regenerates the XMLTV, refreshes the source
        and retries. No parallel mechanism.

        Idempotent and non-clobbering:

        * a channel whose ``epg_data_id`` already belongs to the profile's
          source is a no-op (``already_assigned``);

          hand-assigned real EPG) is never overwritten
          (``skipped_foreign_epg``);
        * only channels with NO guide data are assigned.

        NEVER: creates/deletes channels or touches Dispatcharr group
        settings — assignment is ``epg_data_id`` metadata on existing
        master channels, exactly what standard assign_epg rules write.

        Returns a summary dict the engine folds into the run results:
        counts per disposition plus per-channel ``assign_entries`` for the

        When ``scope_group_id`` is not None (enabled by the rule's
        ``match_scope_target_group`` flag — GH-92 / bd-r9mtd), any candidate
        channel is filtered to require ``channel_group_id == scope_group_id``.
        A match in a different group is treated as "not found" so the caller
        will create a new channel in the desired group instead of merging
        across groups. Passing ``None`` (default) preserves the prior
        group-agnostic behavior.

        When ``exact_only`` is True (bd-0emgo.1), only the exact-key indices are
        consulted (created/base-name/by-name/normalized-name maps); the
        re-normalize and core-name *fuzzy* fallbacks below are SKIPPED. This is
        used by merge_streams target=auto to default to exact normalized-name
        equality. ``exact_only=False`` (default) preserves the GH-104
        duplicate-prevention fallbacks for channel CREATION.

        When ``block_manual`` is True (default — enhancedchannelmanager-orzck /
        W1), any candidate that is a MANUAL channel (``auto_created`` missing or
        falsy) is treated as "not found" so auto-creation never adopts a
        hand-built channel as a merge/update/rename target. The manual channel
        is deliberately LEFT in the lookup maps (so GH-104 dedup still sees it
        and does not create a second copy) — it is rejected only at this
        resolution chokepoint, yielding None so the caller creates a new auto
        channel instead. Callers pass ``block_manual = not
        allow_manual_channel_merge``; the rule-level ``allow_manual_channel_merge``
        flag (default False) is the only way to opt a rule back into adopting
        manual channels.

        When ``fold_key`` is True (GH #645 / bead 0vao3 — the rule's opt-in
        ``fold_match_key`` flag), a LAST-RESORT fallback compares by the
        shared canonical fold key (casefold + strip ALL whitespace, see
        ``match_fold.fold_match_key``) so "Eurosport2" finds "eurosport 2".
        The fold is consulted only after every exact/normalized lookup above
        it misses — an exact match always wins — and the folded candidate
        still passes the same scope and manual-channel gates. Comparison key
        only: stored channel names are never altered.

        Multi-candidate resolution (bead g0uuf): the same channel name in
        several groups is a supported layout, but each lookup map holds ONE
        channel per key. Each stage therefore first tests its legacy
        single-slot pick (preserving historical winner semantics), and only
        when that pick fails the scope/manual gates scans every channel
        indexed under the same key, returning the first that passes. A
        scoped lookup thus finds the same-named channel IN the scoped group
        even when a sibling from another group occupies the single-slot map.
