"""Scheduled + manual cross-instance SyncTask (bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-5gzg5``).

Epic ``i39wu``. Architecture: [ADR-013](../../docs/adr/
ADR-013-cross-instance-live-sync.md) S6 (trigger / overlap guard) and S8
(operational posture). The sync ENGINE (``tasks.dbas_sync_engine.run_sync``) is
built; this module is the THIN ``TaskScheduler`` wrapper that makes it
OPERATOR-TRIGGERABLE — schedulable on an interval AND manually force-triggerable.

What this is
------------
A :class:`~task_scheduler.TaskScheduler` subclass whose ``execute()``:

1. resolves the configured ``SyncTarget`` (``sync_target_id``),
2. runs the FIRE-TIME credential-freshness gate (capture ``credential_version``
   at enqueue; re-check FRESH at execute — abort+WARN+journal+notification on a
   stale/revoked/disabled target, NEVER calling :func:`run_sync`), then
3. calls :func:`tasks.dbas_sync_engine.run_sync` (dry-run default; source-wins
   apply when ``confirm_apply=True``) and maps the returned
   :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreReport` to a TRI-STATE ``TaskResult``.

The freshness gate here mirrors ``DbasBackupTask._check_credential_freshness``.
The engine's :func:`run_sync` ALSO re-runs the same gate internally (defence in
depth) when handed a ``session``; this task's pre-call gate is the layer that
guarantees the bead's contract: a stale target ABORTS without a remote client
ever being built and without :func:`run_sync` being invoked.

Source snapshot posture (bead / ADR-013 S6)
-------------------------------------------
The source set is NOT frozen at enqueue: :func:`run_sync` reads the LOCAL source
config at EXECUTE time. That is the correct converge-over-cycles posture — each
cycle pushes the source's then-current state, so the system converges across runs
rather than replaying a stale snapshot. Only the credential-freshness inputs
(``credential_version``) are captured-at-enqueue + re-checked-at-execute.

task_id / overlap (ADR-013 S6) — ONE task_id PER SyncTarget (bead ``7ipq2.3``)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADR-013 S6: one ``task_id`` per ``SyncTarget`` so distinct targets run
concurrently while the engine's ``ALREADY_RUNNING`` guard (``task_engine.py``,
keyed on ``task_id``) excludes a second run of the SAME target. v1 (bead
``5gzg5``) shipped a single parameterized ``task_id="dbas_sync"`` — safe but
serializing (one slow/unreachable B starved every other target), and two
same-tick due schedules under the shared id silently SWALLOWED the second
target's run (the engine groups due schedules by task_id, runs the FIRST
schedule's parameters, and advances ``next_run_at`` for ALL of them).

Now each target owns a registered task ``dbas_sync_<target_id>`` (a dynamic
:func:`make_sync_task_class` subclass bound to that target):

* **Different targets run concurrently** — distinct task_ids, so the
  scheduler fires them as separate asyncio tasks and the manual /run endpoint
  accepts them independently.
* **Same target never runs twice concurrently** — the engine's per-task_id
  ``ALREADY_RUNNING`` guard IS the per-target lock (refusal is non-silent:
  an explicit failed TaskResult at the API, a retry-next-tick for schedules).
* **No cross-target parameter leakage, by construction** — each target id
  has its own registry singleton; ad-hoc parameters merge into THAT instance
  only. The 7ipq2.2 one-shot disarm still guards run-to-run leakage within a
  target (reset lands on the BOUND target id, see ``bound_sync_target_id``).
* **Bounded concurrency** — a module-level semaphore caps simultaneous sync
  runs across ALL targets (``ECM_SYNC_MAX_CONCURRENT``, default 3; excess
  runs queue, they are not dropped). The task engine's own global
  ``MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS`` additionally bounds scheduled fires.

Lifecycle: :func:`register_sync_target_tasks` (startup, from ``main.py``)
registers every existing target, migrates legacy ``dbas_sync`` schedule rows
to their per-target id, and prunes rows for deleted targets;
:func:`ensure_sync_target_task` / :func:`remove_sync_target_task` are called
from the SyncTarget CRUD router. The base class is NOT statically registered.

Metric attribution — all three sync signals are keyed on the SAME target
identifier (the ``SyncTarget`` pk), so a responder can pivot between them:

* ``ecm_sync_runs_total{result, sync_target_id}`` — tri-state run outcome
  per target (the runbook's "unreachable vs half-applying" triage step).
* ``ecm_sync_last_full_success_timestamp{sync_target_id}`` — freshness of the
  last FULL APPLIED sync; the SLI ``ECMSyncStalledTargetDrift`` keys on.
  Deliberately NOT the generic per-task gauge: the task engine stamps that
  one on any success, and a dry-run PREVIEW succeeds without writing B, so a
  recurring preview would reset the drift clock (PR #752 review).
* ``ecm_task_schedule_last_success_timestamp{task_id="dbas_sync_<id>"}`` —
  generic task health ("did this task run at all"), previews included.

Trigger: MANUAL by default (the operator opts into an interval schedule).
Manual force-sync uses the generic ``POST /api/tasks/dbas_sync_<id>/run``
endpoint with ``parameters={confirm_apply}`` (``sync_target_id`` is optional
and must match the bound target when present). Per-target sync ids are
admin-gated via ``routers.tasks.is_privileged_task_id`` (outbound-write op).

        - EITHER mode carrying ``destination_unreadable``     -> ``success=False``
          (bead ``…-jqfxm``), whatever the counts say.

        That last rule is why the dry-run branch above is not simply "a preview
        always succeeded". A preview's counts are claims ABOUT the destination —
        "would create 24" means "B does not have these 24" — and a run that
        could not read B produces exactly the shape of a run against an EMPTY B,
        because every importer degrades a failed read to ``existing = []``. Live
        validation measured that against a wrong password: ``outcome=success,
        would create 24, failed 0`` while B logged seven 401/429s, and the
        Settings card duly offered Apply (it gates on ``result.success``). A
        preview that never read the destination is a failed preview.

        ON A REALIZED APPLY THE MARKER RULE IS NOW REDUNDANT HERE, and
        deliberately kept: ``compute_outcome`` folds it into the OUTCOME (bead
        ``…-bj442`` — :func:`dbas.restore_orchestrator.outcome_for_unread_destination`),
        so the apply arrives already carrying ``FAILED_ROLLBACK_INCOMPLETE`` and
        the clause below cannot be what makes it fail. What the clause still
        covers on its own is the case an outcome cannot express: a DRY RUN, whose
        realized outcome is ``None`` by contract — both the preview whose
        destination read failed and the cycle the freshness / readback gate
        aborted before ``run_restore`` ever ran. That is why it stays a check on
        the marker rather than on the outcome.

        ``success=False`` is not one severity. A run that FINISHED and left real,
        kept state is DEGRADED, and is declared as such through
        ``completed_degraded`` so the task engine alerts it as a ``warning``
        rather than the red "Task Failed" (bead ``…-daziw``, PO decision

        Bead ``…-daziw``, PO decision 2026-08-19. Such a run is a WARNING, not a
        red "Task Failed": target B carries the applied state, and the summary
        names the shortfall. The task declares the state here; ``task_engine``
        maps state to alert severity
        (:attr:`task_scheduler.TaskResult.completed_degraded`).

        WHY SYNC SHARES THE RESTORE'S RULE INSTEAD OF DEFINING ITS OWN. Sync
        already shared the outcome downgrade — it runs the same orchestrator, so
        an apply that leaves a channel with no playable stream has ALWAYS come
        back ``COMPLETED_WITH_FAILURES`` here. What it did not share was the
        severity, because this method did not exist: the same degraded run
        alerted ``warning`` from a restore and ``error`` / "Task Failed" from a
        sync. A sync-specific definition of success was explicitly NOT chosen —
        it would recreate the bug in the path that runs unattended and
        repeatedly, which is where nobody is watching to catch it by hand.
        Alert VOLUME is handled at the alert layer instead: ``warning`` carries a
        per-task opt-out (``ScheduledTask.alert_on_warning``), so an operator
        with a known, accepted shortfall can silence the alert WITHOUT the code
        reporting success for an instance that cannot play a channel.

        The condition is the OUTCOME
        (:attr:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreOutcome.is_degraded_not_failed`),
        never the particular shortfall — see that property for what keying on
        the shortfall instead cost the restore path (bead ``…-cwmid``).

        A DRY RUN is never degraded: it has no realized outcome, and a preview
        that PREDICTS a shortfall predicted it — nothing was applied to be
        unplayable. A run that failed before reaching the engine returns through
        :meth:`_fail` and never arrives here, so it keeps the error branch.

        NOR is a run that could not read the destination (bead ``…-jqfxm``).
        "Degraded" means the run finished and B carries real, kept state the
        operator can reason about. A run that never got an answer out of B knows
        neither what B carries nor what it applied — that is the error branch,
        not a warning an operator can opt out of. That rule USED TO BE A SECOND
        CONDITION READ HERE, and bead ``…-bj442`` removed it rather than leaving
        it beside the outcome: ``compute_outcome`` now resolves an unread
        destination to ``FAILED_ROLLBACK_INCOMPLETE``
        (:func:`dbas.restore_orchestrator.outcome_for_unread_destination`), which
        ``is_degraded_not_failed`` already answers ``False`` for. Keeping the
        condition here would have re-created exactly what ``…-cwmid`` measured
        and undid — a severity keyed on a condition rather than on the outcome —
        and the point of moving the decision was that ONE decision feeds every
        surface. Pinned by

    INVARIANT: **registration never changes the ``enabled`` state of an
    existing per-target parent row.** The row is the authority; registration
    only chooses the initial value for a row that does not exist yet.

    Why this has to be a property of registration rather than of any one
    caller: ``registry.sync_to_database`` writes ``instance._enabled`` straight
    over whatever row it finds (``task_registry._save_task_to_db``), and the
    per-target sync classes are created dynamically — so on EVERY startup the
    registry hands back a freshly constructed instance still carrying
    ``default_enabled = False``, with ``sync_from_database`` only hydrating it
    afterwards. Persisting before that hydration therefore switched an
    operator's ENABLED sync off on each ordinary restart, and the engine's
    parent gate (``task_engine._check_and_run_due_tasks``) then silently
    stopped the enabled child schedule from firing.

    Hydrating the instance from the row first makes the ``enabled`` write a
    no-op while the rest of the save (display name after a rename, schedule
    fields, run bookkeeping) still lands.

    ``seed_enabled`` is consulted ONLY when no row exists — that is where the
    legacy-migration's preserved firing state enters, as a seed for a row being
    created, never as an override of a row an operator already owns. ``None``
    means "keep whatever the instance already carries".

    Called from ``main.py`` after the task modules import and BEFORE the task
    engine starts (``sync_from_database`` then creates any missing
    ``scheduled_tasks`` rows for the freshly registered ids). Four concerns:

    1. **Register** a bound class for every ``sync_targets`` row.
    2. **Migrate legacy v1 rows** (single shared ``dbas_sync`` id, bead
       5gzg5): each ``task_schedules`` row keyed ``dbas_sync`` is re-keyed to
       the per-target id carried in its ``parameters.sync_target_id``; a row
       whose parameter is missing or points at a deleted target is DISABLED
       (non-silent WARN) rather than re-keyed to an id that can never run.
       The legacy ``scheduled_tasks`` parent row is deleted (its alert/
       notification preferences do NOT carry over to per-target rows).
    3. **Never move an existing per-target parent's enabled gate** (PR #752
       review, Block 1 + its delta). Firing needs BOTH the parent
       ``scheduled_tasks`` gate AND an enabled child row
       (``task_engine._check_and_run_due_tasks``), and the registry
       materialises every per-target instance from ``default_enabled = False``
       on EVERY boot — so persisting a fresh instance is what silently stops a
       working operator schedule. ``_persist_sync_task_row`` holds the
       invariant: an existing row is authoritative and registration only
       chooses the value for a row it creates. That covers both cases with one
       rule — the steady-state restart (row exists: enabled stays enabled,
       disabled stays disabled) and the upgrade (no row yet: seeded from the
       EFFECTIVE pre-upgrade state, i.e. legacy parent enabled — or absent,
       which never blocked — AND at least one migrated child enabled). The
       seed is preserve-only: it never starts a setup that was not firing (a
       disabled parent is the documented kill switch; a disabled child stayed
       off).
    4. **Prune stale per-target rows** for targets deleted while the
       container was down (the CRUD-hook path can't have seen them).

    Defensive: any failure here is logged and swallowed — sync registration
    must never break startup (the engine + every other task still run).
