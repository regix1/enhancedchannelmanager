    """
    Task to clean up old data from the database.

    Configuration options (stored in task config JSON):
    - probe_history_days: Keep probe history for this many days (default: 30)
    - task_history_days: Keep task execution history for this many days (default: 30)
    - journal_days: Keep journal entries for this many days (default: 90)
    - auto_creation_blob_days: NULL out ChannelPipelineExecution BLOB columns
      older than this many days (default: 30) — see bd-ia28g
    - health_checks_days: Delete health_checks rows older than this many days
      (default: 7) — see bd-ia28g
    - notifications_days: Delete notifications older than this many days
      (default: 30) — see bd-ia28g; uses ``expires_at`` if set, else ``created_at``
    - vacuum_db: Run VACUUM after cleanup (default: True)

    ChannelPipelineSnapshot retention (ADR-010 §D7, uc51o.3) is bounded by TWO
    config knobs read from the global Settings (config.py), whichever fires
    first — NOT from this task's own config, so they sit alongside the other
    ``auto_creation_*`` settings and are operator-configurable there:
    - auto_creation_snapshot_days (default 30): age window — prune snapshots
      older than this many days by ``snapshot_time``.
    - auto_creation_snapshot_max (default 50): count cap — keep at most this
      many newest snapshots; older ones pruned regardless of age. This bounds
      the hourly-refresh worst case (50 x up-to-3 MB ~= 150 MB ceiling)
      independent of the age window.
    The prune runs BEFORE the VACUUM step so the freed pages are reclaimed in
    the same maintenance pass. Snapshot counts are bounded (tens, not millions)
    by the count cap, so a single DELETE is fine (no batched-delete-to-dodge-
    the-write-lock concern — ADR-010 §D7).

    M3USnapshot / M3UChangeLog retention (bd-wehek / bd-f9gd8 DBA spike) is
    age-only, from the global Settings (config.py):
    - m3u_snapshot_days (default 90): prune m3u_snapshots rows older than this
      by ``snapshot_time``.
    - m3u_change_log_days (default 90): prune m3u_change_logs rows older than
      this by ``change_time``.
    Both prune steps run BEFORE the VACUUM step (steps 8 and 9 below).

    UniqueClientConnection retention (bd-1wi3y / bd-f9gd8 DBA spike) is
    age-only, from the global Settings (config.py):
    - unique_client_connection_days (default 90): prune rows older than this
      by ``connected_at``.
    Runs BEFORE the VACUUM step (step 9 below).

    Retention rationale (bd-dmu8w): the journal default is 90 days because
    bulk auto-creation now produces per-entity rows (bd-91mcq), amplifying
    journal growth N-fold per run. 90 days is the documented hot-retention
    window and matches ``journal.purge_old_entries``' own default. Operators
    who need a longer audit trail should override this via the task config.

    Retention rationale (bd-ia28g, per bd-p5b8i DBA spike re-attribution):
    auto_creation_executions BLOBs were 77% of the operator DB (127MB / 165MB);
    health_checks was 14% (20MB / 53k rows); notifications 2.2MB. None had
    retention. The bd-f9gd8 spike's session_telemetry headline was the wrong
    target — session_telemetry has its own retention via StatsV2RollupTask
    (bd-7i2vv). This task now covers the three actual large tables.

    The auto_creation_executions prune NULLs out only the four large BLOB
    columns (execution_log, dry_run_results, created_entities,
    modified_entities) — the summary row (id, task_id, status, started_at,
    completed_at, statistics counts) is preserved for audit history per DBA
    recommendation. Operators keep their "what ran when, what was the result"
    audit trail while the multi-MB per-row payloads age out.
