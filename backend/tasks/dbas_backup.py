"""DBAS Backup Task (bead 0i2vt.6).

Scheduled + manually-triggerable producer of the new-format DBAS backup
artifact (the ``.7`` builder, :func:`routers.backup.build_backup_artifact`).
The artifact is a redacted, sealed ZIP plus a ``.sha256`` sidecar written into
``CONFIG_DIR / "backups"`` (same dir convention as ``YamlBackupTask``).

Schedules: MANUAL (default), CRON and INTERVAL, via the existing
``ScheduleConfig`` mechanism. Manual triggering uses the existing
``POST /api/tasks/{task_id}/run`` endpoint — no bespoke endpoint here.

Ships OFF by default (``default_enabled = False``) per the PO decision: a
less-engaged operator can't silently end up with zero backups, so the
one-time "set one up" banner (a separate frontend sub-task) covers discovery.

Fire-time credential-freshness gate (ADR-008 Security Mandatory #5)
------------------------------------------------------------------
The task config may carry an optional ``cloud_target_id`` plus the
``cloud_credential_version`` captured when the schedule was configured. There
is NO owner/user_id model (ECM is single-admin) and NO new DB column — the
two fields live in the task config JSON (``task_schedules.parameters``).

At fire time, when ``cloud_target_id`` is set the task re-reads the
``CloudStorageTarget`` FRESH from the DB and ABORTS the run (no artifact
produced) if ANY of:

  * the target is missing,
  * ``enabled`` is False,
  * ``token_revoked_at`` is not None (hard stop), or
  * ``credential_version`` no longer matches the captured version.

Cloud upload (bead 0i2vt.8)
---------------------------
After the artifact is built, the task uploads it (+ ``.sha256`` sidecar) to each
target listed in the ``cloud_targets`` config (a list of
``{cloud_target_id, cloud_credential_version}``). Per-target tri-state run
semantics (PO decision 2026-06-17): the run is ``success`` only if ALL
configured+enabled targets succeed, ``partial`` if some, ``failed`` if none;
``partial`` and ``failed`` both fire a NotificationCenter notification and
reconcile against ``ecm_backup_runs_total`` (the run is NOT reported as a clean
``success``). Each target is re-validated FRESH against the DB right before its
upload (the per-target generalisation of the single-target gate below); a
stale/revoked target is a non-silent per-target failure. Every upload routes
through the ``.5`` SSRF chokepoint, is executor-wrapped, streams from disk, and
masks credentials in logs. Uploads run ONE AT A TIME (cap=1) to bound memory.

The legacy single ``cloud_target_id`` pre-build gate (below) is unchanged: when
set, a stale bound target ABORTS the whole run (no artifact) — distinct from the
``cloud_targets`` post-build per-target failure path.

Silent-skip MUST notify
-----------------------
A freshness-gate abort is NOT silent: it emits a WARN log (``[DBAS_BACKUP]``
prefix), a ``journal`` entry, AND a NotificationCenter notification, and
returns ``TaskResult(success=False, ...)``. A scheduled backup that silently
stops = false safety.

Degraded gather = WARNING, never a silent clean success (bead zt3kf)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
``build_backup_artifact`` gathers Dispatcharr-managed categories per-key
(``routers.backup._gather_dispatcharr_sections``), and each category's fetch
is isolated: a single upstream failure stubs ONLY that category into the
artifact as ``{"_warning": ...}`` rather than aborting the whole gather or
degrading unrelated categories. Before this fix, that stub was invisible
downstream — a backup missing an entire category (e.g. every
``dvr_rules.yaml`` on a run where the Dispatcharr endpoint errored) still
reported a clean ``TaskResult(success=True, failed_count=0)``. Now:
``artifact.degraded_categories`` (populated by the builder) is threaded into
``details["degraded_categories"]`` and the run is reported as WARNING-level —
``success`` stays ``True`` (a real, checksum-verified artifact WAS produced
and is useful), but ``failed_count`` is set so task_engine.py's existing
"Completed with Warnings" branch fires, naming the degraded category/
categories in both the task message and the completion notification
(``task_engine._warning_task_completion_message``). Cloud-upload health
(below) takes precedence when both are unhealthy — an upload failure is the
more severe, already-notified condition.

The counts are ITEM counts, and the item is a CATEGORY (bead …-fexq1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
``zt3kf`` reached that warning branch with ``total_items=1`` and the two
counters in ``{0, 1}`` — enough to satisfy ``failed_count > 0``, but a boolean
wearing the shape of item counts. One surface over, a backup that archived
fifteen categories cleanly and stubbed one wrote ``0 ok, 1 failed`` into the
Journal, the task-history row and the progress notification: a restorable
artifact described as a total loss to anyone scanning at a glance.
:meth:`DbasBackupTask._counts_from_artifact` now derives the counts from the
artifact's own per-category outcome — the same shape ``dbas_restore``'s
``RestoreCounts`` uses. Severity is deliberately unmoved by that: the ladder
keys on ``failed_count > 0``, which still holds exactly when a category
degraded.

The SAME rule covers a partial LOGO-BYTE gather (bead …-xb58a). Logo images live
in Dispatcharr, so the builder fetches them at gather time; when some of those
fetches fail the artifact is built and useful but carries fewer logo bytes than
the operator expects, and a restore will report those as logo misses. The
builder therefore adds ``"logos"`` to ``degraded_categories`` and reports the
COUNT in ``artifact.unarchived_logo_bytes``, which lands in
``details["unarchived_logo_bytes"]`` and the task message. Shipping that as a
clean success would be the same defect the logo-bytes bead exists to fix.

A channel whose ``epg_data_id`` points at a guide row that no longer exists is
DIFFERENT in kind (bead …-dfkbn, PR review W2). Its link cannot be restored, and
the count reaches ``details["unresolved_epg_links"]`` and the task message so the
operator can see it, but it does NOT set ``failed_count`` and does NOT add a
degraded category: a dangling FK is common, largely unactionable, and is not ECM
failing to gather something it could have. Making it a WARNING would erode the
badge that the two conditions above depend on.

Metrics: ``ecm_backup_runs_total{result="success"|"partial"|"skipped"|"failed"}``
and ``ecm_backup_upload_total{provider,result}`` (per-upload outcome). Gather
degradation does not get its own metric label — it is a data-completeness
signal on the local artifact, orthogonal to the upload-destination health this
metric tracks.

Concurrency: the engine's ``TaskScheduler.run()`` already rejects a second
concurrent run of the same ``task_id`` (ALREADY_RUNNING guard), so no extra
self-exclusion is needed here.

    """The operator-facing sentence for the recordings this backup left behind.

    Bead ``…-ciabe``. PUBLIC (no leading underscore) because it is the visible
    half of an ADR-013 exclusion, and its own test asserts what it says — an
    exclusion notice that nothing pins is one word away from silently becoming a
    disclaimer with no content.

    Two properties it has to hold, both learned from the counts already in this
    message:

    * It NAMES THE REMEDY, not just the number. The recordings are absent because
      their media files sit on the SOURCE instance's disk and no API can carry
      them; the only thing that can is the operator copying them. A count with no
      remedy reads as a defect report rather than a boundary of the product.
    * It says NOTHING WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY. A standing disclaimer on
      every run is wallpaper — the operator stops reading it, which is the same
      end state as never having printed it, and it would drown the counts beside
      it that DO vary.

    Recordings excluded because a recurring rule regenerates them are
    deliberately not mentioned: nothing is lost, the ``dvr_rules`` category
    carries their generator, and there is no action to take. That count is in
    ``details`` for anyone who wants it.

        THE ITEM IS A CATEGORY. That is what the gather iterates, what
        ``degraded_categories`` already names, and the only unit this run has
        more than one of. Mirrors ``dbas_restore``'s ``RestoreCounts``, which
        likewise derives its numbers from the per-category outcome instead of
        inventing a scalar::

            total_items   = artifact.gathered_categories
            failed_count  = len(degraded_categories)
            success_count = total_items - failed_count

        ``zt3kf`` originally wired the degraded signal in as ``total_items=1``
        with the two counters in ``{0, 1}`` — a BOOLEAN in the shape of item
        counts — because reaching the existing "Completed with Warnings" branch
        only needed ``failed_count > 0``. The cost showed up one surface over:
        a backup that archived fifteen categories cleanly and stubbed one wrote
        ``0 ok, 1 failed`` into the Journal, the task-history row and the
        progress notification. A real, checksum-verified, restorable artifact,
        described as a total loss to an operator scanning at a glance.

        SEVERITY IS UNCHANGED, and that is a requirement, not a coincidence.
        ``task_scheduler``'s ladder keys on ``failed_count > 0``, and that
        predicate still holds exactly when ``degraded_categories`` is non-empty
        — the count moves from 1 to N, never from 1 to 0. A clean backup stays
        ``success``, a degraded one stays ``warning``, and an upload failure
        stays ``error`` through ``success=False``, which no count can soften.

        The counts describe the GATHER, in both the upload-succeeded and
        upload-failed cases, so the unit never silently changes meaning with
        the weather; upload health is carried by ``success`` / ``error`` /
        ``details["upload"]``.
