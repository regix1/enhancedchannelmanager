"""
Rule Lint Scan — one-time read-only scan of existing rule rows.

Walks ``normalization_rules``, ``auto_creation_rules``, and
``dummy_epg_profiles``, runs :func:`regex_lint.lint_pattern` against
every user-supplied pattern field (including patterns buried inside the
JSON-encoded ``conditions`` / ``actions`` / ``substitution_pairs`` columns),
and writes findings to ``rule_lint_findings``. Does NOT mutate any rule
row — the scan is purely diagnostic.

Bead: bd-eio04.7. Runs on startup (see :func:`main.startup_event`) so pre-lint
rows that would now fail the write-time linter become visible in the UI
without the operator having to manually re-save every rule.

Idempotency contract: before each scan, existing findings for each rule
row are deleted and rewritten. Re-running the scan against an unchanged
corpus produces an identical result set (same count, same codes, same
messages; ``detected_at`` refreshes).
