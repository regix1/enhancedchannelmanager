"""DBAS Restore Task (bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-o8tbv``).

The async, progress-emitting restore that makes a new-format DBAS artifact
user-triggerable and observable — the missing integration piece for the
v0.18.0 full round-trip. Mirrors :class:`tasks.dbas_backup.DbasBackupTask`: a
``TaskScheduler`` subclass whose ``execute()`` runs the whole restore pipeline
and emits ``_set_progress`` at each of the 13 canonical stages
(``frontend/src/utils/restoreStages.ts``) so the frontend can poll
``/api/tasks/{id}`` and render "Stage N of M".

Pipeline (validate -> decode -> dry-run-default -> orchestrate)
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open the streamed-to-disk artifact (the restore endpoint streamed the upload
   to a temp file on the CONFIG partition; this task never sees the raw upload).
2. ``routers.backup.validate_artifact_manifest`` — the .17 gate (version +
   per-member SHA-256) runs BEFORE any decode or mutation. A refusal returns a
   failed ``TaskResult`` with ZERO importer ever called.
3. ``dbas.restore_artifact.decode_artifact_to_plan`` — turn the validated ZIP
   into the orchestrator's :class:`~dbas.preflight.ImportPlan` (per-category
   records + the binary logo subtree decoded into .15 logo records).
4. Run the orchestrator. **Dry-run is default-ON** (.16): the task calls
   :func:`dbas.restore_orchestrator.run_dry_run` UNLESS the task config carries
   ``confirm_apply=True``, in which case it calls ``run_restore(...,
   confirm_apply=True)`` with the apply registry. The orchestrator's own
   guardrail is the final, unbypassable enforcement — even a misconfigured task
   degrades to a counts-only dry-run rather than mutating.
5. Return the :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreReport` in the
   ``TaskResult.details`` so the frontend's ``.20`` summary can render it.

Temp-artifact cleanup
---------------------
The task deletes the temp artifact on BOTH success and failure (the endpoint
owns creation; the task owns teardown so the file does not outlive the run).
``cleanup_artifact`` defaults to True; the restore endpoint sets it.

Security (untrusted upload — security-review surface)
-----------------------------------------------------
Validate-before-mutate is structural: ``validate_artifact_manifest`` runs before
``decode_artifact_to_plan``, which runs before the orchestrator. The decode
itself never extracts to disk (zip-slip safe — see ``dbas.restore_artifact``).
Logging is credential-clean: only safe fields (filename, schema_version, counts,
outcome) are logged; never an artifact path that could embed a token, never an
upstream SDK body. The temp artifact is the endpoint's concern for mode/cleanup.
