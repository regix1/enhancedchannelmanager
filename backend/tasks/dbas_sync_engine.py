"""One-way cross-instance sync ENGINE CORE — config categories (epic ``i39wu``).

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-tjaey``. Architecture: [ADR-013](../../docs/adr/
ADR-013-cross-instance-live-sync.md) S1/S3/S4/S5/S7/S9. Security: threat model
``docs/security/threat_model_dbas_import.md`` §11 Addendum D (D2/D3/D5/D8/D9).

What this is (the proven thesis — spike ``xp6mp``)
--------------------------------------------------
Sync is **"restore over HTTP"**. The DBAS restore orchestrator
(``dbas.restore_orchestrator.run_restore`` / ``run_dry_run``) and its importers
take the Dispatcharr ``client`` as an injected parameter — the ONLY coupling to
"local" is a single ``get_client()`` call in the archive-restore task. So sync:

1. gathers the LOCAL source-A config (the SAME ``_gather_dispatcharr_sections``
   pointed at ``get_client()`` the backup builder uses),
2. REDACTS it via the shared ``_REDACT_KEYS`` deep redactor — with ONE deliberate
   exception, the provider credential fields, which cross on every cycle under the
   PO's 2026-08-22 ruling (see :data:`PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_SECTIONS`). ECM's own
   secrets, alert-method secrets and target credentials do not,
3. maps each category to its :class:`EntityType` (the SAME
   ``restore_artifact._SECTION_TO_ENTITY`` table the archive decoder uses),
4. assembles an :class:`~dbas.preflight.ImportPlan` whose manifest carries
   ``schema_version = BACKUP_SCHEMA_VERSION`` (the orchestrator runs the .17
   pre-flight gate; without the stamp it refuses the plan — spike empirical find),
5. and runs the UNCHANGED orchestrator against a remote (dest-B) client built
   from a ``SyncTarget`` row (``dbas_sync_client.make_remote_client``).

The orchestrator, importers, and post-import natural-key reattachment machinery
are reused rather than reimplemented. Sync-specific code remains the live-source
plan reader, config-only step registry, ``run_sync``, and shared never-sync
constant.

Scope of THIS engine (ADR-013 phasing / S9)
-------------------------------------------
CONFIG categories (bead ``tjaey``): ``m3u_accounts``, ``epg_sources``,
``channel_groups``, ``channel_profiles``, ``stream_profiles``, plus the two
FK-OWNER categories their dependents resolve through — ``user_agents`` (bead
``…-hiacv``) and ``server_groups`` (bead ``…-tyrg1``) — and ``core_settings``
(bead ``…-10wnq``), which S9 and S3 have listed since this ADR was written and
which appeared nowhere in this engine until that bead. Core settings are
key/value BLOBS rather than an entity list, so they are absent from
``_SECTION_TO_ENTITY`` by design and the plan assembler gives them their own
branch; WHICH blobs cross is the per-blob register
(:data:`SYNC_CORE_SETTINGS_BLOBS` / :data:`NEVER_SYNC_CORE_SETTINGS_BLOBS`).

CHANNELS + STREAMS (bead ``kcxie``, Phase-2): the channels category is gathered
WITH its embedded streams and synced AFTER the config categories, through the
SAME reused ``import_channels`` importer, but with the spike ``xp6mp`` DBA
collision-safe floor applied for the continuous-sync context:

* **Channels (ruling 1a)** — a ``(name, channel_number)`` name match where the
  number is null/absent on BOTH sides is AMBIGUOUS and is surfaced as a
  ``CONFLICT`` (failed-with-reason), never a silent ``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL``.
  That fix lives uniformly in ``dbas/importers/channels.py`` (it was a latent
  one-shot bug); this engine simply reuses the corrected importer.
* **Streams (ruling 1b)** — the embedded-stream matcher is FLOORED at Tier-3
  exact-normalized for the sync path. Tier-4 fuzzy (``token_set_ratio``) is
  opt-in per ``SyncTarget`` via ``fuzzy_stream_matching`` (default off); when on,
  a fuzzy hit is flagged LOW-CONFIDENCE in ``report.notes``, never a silent
  ``updated``. The flag threads from the target row into ``import_channels`` via
  its ``allow_fuzzy_stream_match`` parameter — AND into ``run_restore``'s
  parameter of the same name, which is what carries it to the post-create
  placeholder rebind. Both, always: the rebind is a SECOND matcher pass over the
  same archived streams, and for a while it was the half that silently ignored
  the flag (bead ``…-efvyg``), so a target with fuzzy OFF still had a channel
  bound to a wrong-but-similar destination stream while the cycle reported
  success. The floor is a property of the CYCLE, not of one importer.

LOGOS are SUB-INTERVALLED per target, not per-cycle-unconditional (ADR-013 S9):
the logos importer carries a DESTRUCTIVE ``clear_existing`` bulk-delete plus a
per-logo streaming-upload cost that does not belong in the default per-cycle
slice. The guarded slice this engine ships is exactly the S9 exit path — but the
exit is now taken through the interval rather than through the toggle.
``SyncTarget.sync_logos`` DEFAULTS ON (bead ``…-2yq19``): it shipped OFF under
``7ipq2.1``, and because the recorded reason was COST rather than correctness,
ADR-013's faithful-copy principle rules an OFF default a silent omission — a
replica arriving with no artwork at all is the second half of what epic
``f5a5j`` is named for. The cost is answered by ``logo_sync_interval_hours``
(default 24, ``0`` = every cycle) and ``last_logo_sync_at``; see
:func:`logo_slice_is_due`. When the slice runs the LOGO
category is assembled METADATA-ONLY (never bytes in the plan) and the REUSED
logos importer runs with ``clear_existing`` hard-disabled (the sync path can
NEVER bulk-delete B's logos) and a lazy ``content_provider`` that hydrates each
MISSED logo one at a time (D8 streaming: match first, hydrate misses only, one
payload live at a time). Bead ``…-cfxml``: that gather covers BOTH logo sources
the backup artifact carries — the files under ECM's own ``/config/uploads/logos/``
AND the bytes of every DISPATCHARR-HOSTED logo, fetched from Dispatcharr at
hydration time. Dispatcharr is ECM's source of truth for logos, so before that
a replica received only whatever happened to sit in A's upload directory. The
fetches are wall-clock bounded per fetch and per cycle, because unlike a backup
this runs unattended on a schedule. Bead ``…-xgbjm`` closed the other half: the
bytes crossing is not the same as the CHANNEL-TO-LOGO BINDING crossing, and for
a while only the first did — B's Logo Manager showed the synced logo as UNUSED
while every channel on B carried ``logo_id`` null. The LOGO step now runs the
same post-create reattach pass the archive-restore registry runs, which is what
its LAST position in the registry exists to make possible.

Users NEVER sync (D3). The deferred auto-sync / EPG-download phase is **not** run
per cycle (S9) — the step registry passes a deferred-apply no-op to the
orchestrator.

This module is the ENGINE FUNCTION. The scheduled-task wrapper + manual trigger
(``TaskScheduler`` subclass, overlap guard) is a separate bead (``5gzg5``);
``run_sync`` is kept callable + testable so that wrapper is a thin shell.

Conventions (``docs/style_guide.md``): ``snake_case``; Google-style docstrings;
lazy ``%``-formatted logging; no secrets in any log or report field.

# ADR-013 S9 and S3 have listed "core settings" in the per-cycle set since the

# It was the last S9 category still missing after bead ``…-hiacv`` added user
# agents.
#
# THE TRAP THIS AVOIDS, named on the bead: core settings are key/value BLOBS and
# are deliberately absent from ``_SECTION_TO_ENTITY`` (which maps sections to
# ENTITY-LIST categories). The plan assembler below iterates that table, so
# adding a category key alone would have been INERT — wired-looking and moving
# nothing. The SETTINGS category is therefore assembled by its own branch, in
# the ``{"section", "values"}`` shape the orchestrator's settings step consumes.
#
# THE SEVEN BLOBS, read off dispatcharr:latest (0.29.0 ``core/models.py``) on
# 2026-08-23 rather than from the recorded fixture, because the fixture is a
# 0.28.2 shape capture with the values stripped. Each entry below states what
# the blob actually contains and why it is in or out.

        # 2026-08-21 reason was "may legitimately differ if the replica has
        # different hardware" — a PREFERENCE, which the principle rejects as a
        # class. But a real functional risk does exist behind it: tuning copied
        # onto slower hardware can degrade playback on B. The ADR's own reading
        # is that this argues for an opt-out rather than omission, so it
        # replicates by default and an operator who needs B tuned differently

        # schedule_day_of_week / schedule_cron_expression / retention_count
        # (0.29.0 ``apps/backups/scheduler.py``), and unlike the other two it
        # DOES name a specific harm: both instances then run their backup job on
        # the same schedule, and B's retention count is bounded by B's storage,
        # not A's. Against that: a standby with no backup schedule at all is a
        # replica missing settings, and it is missing them silently. The ADR
        # names two ways out — replicate-with-offset, or a per-target opt-out —
        # and this takes the opt-out, because an OFFSET would have ECM inventing
        # a schedule neither instance was configured with, which is a third
        # state rather than a faithful copy. An operator who does not want B
        # backing itself up names the blob in the same exclusion list.

# the M3U/EPG output (measured across ``apps/accounts``, ``apps/timeshift``,
# ``apps/output`` and ``apps/proxy``). Replicating A's allowlist onto a replica
# that sits somewhere else on the network either LOCKS THE OPERATOR OUT OF B or
# OPENS B UP, depending on which way the two differ. That is a specific,

# is the ONLY core-settings blob that keeps its exclusion.

# made about an operator action a human watches and can retry.
#
# CONTINUOUS SYNC IS THE OPPOSITE CONTEXT, and this constant is the whole of the
# difference. It runs unattended, forever, on a schedule, with nobody reading
# the result. Three facts make a rollback there strictly destructive:
#
# * A setting is NEVER LEDGERED — ``_delete_dispatch`` has no SETTINGS
#   compensator by design — so the rollback cannot undo the settings. It only
#   deletes the M3U accounts, EPG sources, groups, profiles and channels the
#   cycle successfully created. It fixes nothing and costs everything.
# * The trigger is as small as ONE unreadable ``GET /api/core/settings/`` on the
#   destination, or one blob key a version-skewed B does not have. That is the
#   ``…-d0agi`` trade — a whole replica for a cosmetic config defect — in a
#   category that cannot even be compensated.
# * ADR-013 S8 makes "just retry next interval" the recovery mechanism for this
#   engine. A rollback is precisely what destroys the state that makes retry
#   converge.
#
# The failures are still COUNTED, still in ``failure_details``, and still forbid

#
# THE RULING, verbatim: "We should be sending credentials every time so that we
# don't need the user to deal with needing to re-type anything. Any update
# happens as soon as the next scheduled sync occurs." The operator owns both
# instances; a replica whose provider credential is absent or stale is not a
# replica, and the re-typing that closed the gap is the thing being removed.
#
# THIS SUPERSEDES the one-time provisioning action (bead ``wd20y``, PR #908) and
# the setup-only and change-detected cascades considered the same day. There is
# no separate action, no marker column, no version gate and no change detector:
# the credential fields are simply part of what the cycle writes, so rotation on
# A reaches B on the next cycle by construction rather than by mechanism.
#
# WHAT BEAD ``msqf7`` ACTUALLY FORBIDS, and it is not this. That bead was not
# about transmitting a credential; it was about ECM TELLING THE OPERATOR
# credentials were stripped while transmitting them anyway, implicitly, inside
# stream-URL path segments that nothing inspected. Deliberate transmission with
# the product's own words matching the behaviour is the opposite of that defect.
# The operator-facing text was corrected in the same commit as this constant —
# ``docs/user_guide/backup-restore/cross-instance-sync.md``, the sync journal
# row, and the SyncTargets card all now say credentials cross on every cycle.
#
# THE SCOPE IS THE PROVIDER SECTIONS ONLY, and this is the precise half. The
# sections named here are pure third-party provider configuration:
# ``m3u_accounts`` and ``epg_sources``. Everything ELSE the redactor covers is
# redacted exactly as before — ECM's own settings secrets, alert-method secrets,
# cloud-target and sync-target credentials, and ``dispatcharr_users`` (which is
# never synced at all, D3). A new gathered category does NOT inherit this
# exception; it has to be added here, deliberately.

# ``apps/m3u/serializers.py`` — ``M3UAccountSerializer.Meta.fields`` carries
# exactly ``username`` and ``password``; ``apps/epg/serializers.py`` —
# ``EPGSourceSerializer.Meta.fields`` carries exactly the same two. Neither

# outside its test fixtures. The previous comment here asserted that "an EPG
# source given a URL but no ``api_key`` fetches nothing"; there is no
# ``api_key`` on an EPG source to give it.
#
# THIS IS A LITERAL BECAUSE IT IS A FACT ABOUT DISPATCHARR, not about ECM's
# idea of what a credential is. It changes when Dispatcharr's serializers
# change, which is a deliberate act with a diff to read — not when ECM adds a

#
# DERIVED FROM THE REDACTOR'S OWN VOCABULARY, then INTERSECTED with the fields
# that can actually occur on one of these two entities. The derivation is what
# keeps the two rules from drifting apart about what a credential IS: a name

    from exactly this field since bead …-dfkbn
    (:func:`~dbas.importers.logos._create_logo_from_url`); the backup builder

    Xtream Codes provider puts the account's username and password in PATH
    SEGMENTS of the addresses it hands out, and a logo url comes from the same
    provider; this gather used to DROP such a url and report the logo as a named

    * every REMOTE-URL logo (:func:`_remote_logo_records`, bead …-sgrez). The

    TWO PASSES, and the split is the whole of the precision the PO's ruling

    * The PROVIDER sections (:data:`PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_SECTIONS`) are redacted
      with :data:`PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_KEYS` preserved AND with the URL-credential
      rule disabled, because a plain-M3U account has no password field at all —
      its whole credential lives inside ``server_url``'s query string, and an
      account that receives a sentinelled ``server_url`` authenticates against
      nothing. The same is true of an authenticated XMLTV EPG ``url``. Every
      other redaction rule still runs over these sections.
    * EVERY OTHER section is redacted exactly as it was before this ruling:
      the full denylist, the identity half, and the URL rule. ECM's own settings
      secrets, alert-method secrets and cloud/sync-target credentials are not
      provider credentials and do not cross.

    THE PATH-SEGMENT RULE IS OFF FOR THE PROVIDER SECTIONS AND UNCHANGED
    EVERYWHERE ELSE. That harvest (bead ``…-msqf7``) exists to find a credential
    hiding in a URL PATH SEGMENT so it can be replaced. In the provider sections
    the credential is carried on purpose, so running it there would sentinel the
    very values the replica needs. Everywhere else it stays exactly as armed as
    it was — note the harvest reads the WHOLE gather, not just the sections it
    is applied to, because the values it looks for LIVE in the provider sections

    operator found and flipped the toggle — the second half of the failure epic

    the sub-interval is faithful in every sense an operator can observe.

) -> tuple[ImportPlan, dict[EntityType, list[dict]]]:
    """Dedup name-unique categories so a source-side duplicate degrades to a
    per-item CONFLICT instead of preflight's all-or-nothing plan refusal.

    ``dbas.preflight._validate_unique_names`` refuses the ENTIRE plan when ANY
    :data:`~dbas.preflight.NAME_UNIQUE_CATEGORIES` category carries two entities
    sharing a (trimmed, case-insensitive) name — correct for backup/restore,
    where a half-applied one-shot snapshot is worse than no restore at all
    (ADR / Dispatcharr has no DB transactions). Continuous cross-instance sync
    has the opposite failure mode: one duplicated name anywhere in the source
    (e.g. two channel groups both named "World Cup 2026") must not blank out
    every OTHER category's diff. This mirrors the per-item tolerance
    ``dbas/importers/channels.py`` already applies to an unrelated ambiguity
    (``_is_ambiguous_null_key`` — a name collision with a null channel_number on
    both sides is surfaced as a CONFLICT for that one channel, not a plan
    refusal) rather than inventing a second tolerance model.

    For each category in :data:`NAME_UNIQUE_CATEGORIES` — the SAME set
    preflight checks, imported directly so the two lists can never drift apart
    on which categories they cover — entities are scanned in archive order
    using preflight's EXACT normalization (``name.strip().lower()``; a missing,
    non-string, or empty name is left alone and never flagged, matching
    ``_validate_unique_names``). The first entity to claim a given name is kept;
    every later entity with the same name is removed from the returned plan and
    recorded in the excluded mapping so the caller can surface it as a CONFLICT
    once the (now preflight-safe) plan has been restored.

    Dropping a duplicate is not enough on its own: a CHANNEL entity elsewhere in
    the plan may carry a ``channel_group_id`` / ``stream_profile_id`` (the two
    fields :data:`~dbas.preflight.CHANNEL_FK_FIELDS` points at) that referenced
    the EXCLUDED duplicate's source id. Left alone, that reference would dangle
    and ``dbas.preflight._validate_fk_references`` would refuse the WHOLE
    (now-deduped) plan again — reproducing the exact all-or-nothing refusal this
    function exists to avoid, just via a different validator. So this function
    also builds a source-id -> kept-id remap for every FK-target category
    (:data:`~dbas.preflight.CHANNEL_FK_FIELDS` values) and rewrites any CHANNEL
    entity's matching FK field that pointed at an excluded id, so it now points
    at the surviving same-named entity instead.

    Args:
        plan: The freshly-assembled live-source plan, not yet preflighted.

    Returns:
        A tuple of ``(deduped_plan, excluded)`` where ``excluded`` maps each

        ``PreflightProblemKind.DUPLICATE_UNIQUE_NAME`` — every name-unique
        category now carries at most one entity per normalized name — and any
        CHANNEL FK that referenced a dropped duplicate has been remapped onto
        the entity that survived, so it cannot trigger
        ``PreflightProblemKind.UNRESOLVED_FK_REFERENCE`` either.

    THE SILENT HALF OF THIS BEAD, and the reason its "just sync the blob" ruling
    could not be implemented as written. Three of ``stream_settings``' five
    members are FOREIGN KEY IDS the destination assigns itself:
    ``default_user_agent`` and ``default_stream_profile`` (both remappable —
    ECM syncs those categories) and ``hdhr_output_profile_id`` (not — ECM has no
    ``OutputProfile`` category).

    IT IS SILENT WHERE ITS SIBLINGS WERE LOUD. When bead ``…-9h6cv`` forwarded a
    raw ``user_agent`` pk on an M3U account, B answered
    ``400 {"user_agent": ["Invalid pk \\"4\\" ..."]}`` and the whole apply rolled
    back — painful, but the defect announced itself. A settings blob is a JSON
    value: Dispatcharr stores whatever integer it is handed and validates
    nothing, so forwarding A's ids here would simply point B's default user agent
    and default stream profile at whichever rows happen to hold those numbers.
    No error, no counter, no report — precisely the failure mode this epic keeps
    removing.

    SENTINELS ARE STRIPPED, NOT WRITTEN. The gather runs the deep redactor over
    every non-provider section, so a nested member whose key name looks
    credential-class arrives as the redaction placeholder. Writing that through
    would replace B's real value with the literal string ``***REDACTED***`` —
    the ``…-6pilh`` defect, one layer down. A sentinel-valued member is DROPPED
    instead, so B keeps what it has.

    covered every field on the row — ``server_url``, ``max_streams``,
    ``user_agent``, ``refresh_interval``, ``custom_properties``, the credential
    fields and the four preference booleans alike. ADR-013 S5 says source-wins.
    The two disagreed, and this step is the reconciliation the bead asked for:
    S5 governs, and every field xp6mp froze is now either converged or carries a
    written exclusion.

    WHY THE FLAG RATHER THAN A UNIFORM CHANGE. The archive-restore registries
    keep the old behaviour, on the same reasoning bead ``…-avrix`` used for its
    ``created: False`` flag. Continuous sync is what turns a frozen field into
    permanent silent divergence — it runs unattended, forever, and nobody looks.
    A one-shot restore onto a populated instance is an operator action with a
    different blast radius and a different question behind it, and answering it
    is not this bead's to decide.

    IT DOES NOT DUPLICATE THE PER-CYCLE CREDENTIAL CASCADE — it COMPLETES it.
    Measured on this branch's base: the cascade puts the real ``username`` /
    ``password`` / credential-bearing address into the PLAN, and the CREATE path
    writes them, but the existing-account branch issued no write at all, so a
    credential rotated on A never reached a replica that already had the
    account. There is exactly one writer for the row, here, and the credential
    fields ride it like every other field.

    WHY THIS REPLACED A NO-OP (bead ``…-avrix``). Dropping the settings on the

    ``ChannelGroupM3UAccount`` rows against the source's 777 (2 enabled), and
    ``channel_group_drift`` reported ``0`` throughout because it measures which
    group a CHANNEL sits in, not which of an ACCOUNT's groups are switched on.
    Given credentials, the replica's own refresh then answered ``Filtered 0
    streams from 0 enabled categories`` and aborted — 0 streams against the
    source's 316 — and with ``auto_enable_new_groups_live`` at Dispatcharr's own
    default of ``True`` the same empty selection enabled 777 of 777 categories
    instead, i.e. the provider's entire 53,661-stream catalogue. The invariant
    this restores: a replica ingests the same provider content the source
    ingests, or the run says plainly that it will not.

    outcome, FIELD names) are logged; never a credential value.

    THE REDACTION MODE IS NOW ``topology_plus_provider_credentials``, and the
    rename is not cosmetic. This row said ``topology_only`` while bead
    ``…-msqf7`` was live and the cycle was carrying the provider's username and
    password inside every stream URL — the audit row asserting the exact thing
    that was false. Under the 2026-08-22 ruling the cycle carries them
    deliberately, so the row says so, on every run, with the affected records
    named. That is the whole of what ``msqf7`` requires of this feature: the
    product's words match the behaviour.

    ``credential_records`` / ``credential_count`` are the surviving form of bead
    ``…-gad2p``'s invariant — no credential-carrying attempt terminates without
    an audit row. The two failure routes that bead measured (a gate refusal with
    no row, a de-provision against an unreachable destination with no row) do not
    exist any more: the gate and the de-provision action were both deleted. What
    replaced them is that EVERY terminal route of a cycle writes this row — the

       FRESH. A non-None reason ABORTS the cycle fail-closed: no remote client is
       built, no writes happen, the abort is journalled (``sync_outbound``), and a
       report carrying the reason in ``notes`` (``outcome=None``) is returned.
    2. **Remote client** — :func:`make_remote_client` builds an SSRF-guarded
       dest-B client from the target row.
    3. **Live-source plan** — :func:`build_live_source_plan` gathers + redacts A's
       config categories (D2) into an :class:`ImportPlan` (never users — D3).
    4. **Restore** — the UNCHANGED :func:`run_restore` runs the config-only step
       registry against dest-B. ``confirm_apply=False`` (the DEFAULT) produces a
       counts-only dry-run (would-create) with ZERO writes; ``confirm_apply=True``
       applies source-wins (A overwrites B; match→skip-or-create idempotent).
    5. **Audit (D9)** — the run is journalled (categories, counts, result,
       redaction_mode).

    Args:
        sync_target: a ``SyncTarget`` ORM row (or any object exposing ``id`` /
            ``name`` / ``base_url`` / ``credentials`` / ``enabled`` /
            ``token_revoked_at`` / ``credential_version`` / ``insecure`` /
            ``fuzzy_stream_matching`` / ``sync_logos``).
        confirm_apply: opt-IN to MUTATE B. ``False`` (default) is a counts-only
            dry-run (no writes); ``True`` applies source-wins.
        session: an open DB session for the freshness re-read. The caller owns its
            lifecycle. Optional only so the dry-run preview can run without one;
            when ``None`` the freshness gate is skipped (the scheduled wrapper
            bead ``5gzg5`` always passes one).
        captured_version: the ``credential_version`` captured at enqueue, threaded
            to the freshness gate (D5). ``None`` skips the version check.
        ledger_dir: override the durable rollback-ledger directory (tests).

    Returns:
        The :class:`RestoreReport` — dry-run (``is_dry_run=True``, ``outcome=None``)
        or a realized apply with the tri-state ``outcome``. On a freshness abort,
