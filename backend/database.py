# --- WAL-growth backstop (bd-12hxn / GH #473) ----------------------------
# The startup ``_wal_checkpoint_truncate`` (bd-ej995 / GH #274) only bounds the
# WAL at boot. DURING a long run the passive auto-checkpoint that SQLite would
# normally fire every ``wal_autocheckpoint`` pages gets STARVED whenever a
# reader (e.g. the stats poller) holds a read transaction across the checkpoint
# window — exactly the GH #274 pinned-reader pathology — so the -wal can grow
# without bound until the next restart truncates it. Under the GH #473 memory
# spike that unbounded growth compounds the disk/swap pressure that corrupted
# journal.db.
#
# We bound it per-connection with two cheap PRAGMA levers (no new background
# task lifecycle to own/test):
#
#   * ``journal_size_limit`` caps how many bytes of WAL are RETAINED after a
#     checkpoint reclaims it. Without a limit SQLite keeps the WAL file at its
#     high-water mark (it only ever truncates on an explicit TRUNCATE
#     checkpoint), so a single growth spike leaves the file large for the rest
#     of the run. With the limit, an ordinary auto-checkpoint shrinks the file
#     back to the cap. This does NOT fight the boot TRUNCATE checkpoint —
#     TRUNCATE still takes the WAL to zero; the limit only governs the retained
#     size of incremental checkpoints during the run.
#   * ``wal_autocheckpoint`` sets the page threshold at which a committing
#     connection attempts a PASSIVE checkpoint. SQLite's default is 1000 pages
#     (~4 MB at the default 4 KB page size). We keep that default frequency —
#     lowering it would checkpoint more often (more contention with readers),
#     raising it would let the WAL run further between checkpoints. 1000 is a
#     well-tuned default; we set it explicitly so the value is visible and
#     can't drift if a future SQLite changes its default.
#
# 64 MiB cap: comfortably above normal steady-state WAL (a few MB), well below
# the 1.4 GB GH #274 incident and the multi-GB pressure of GH #473. A reader
# that pins the WAL can still let it grow past the cap transiently (the cap is
# enforced at checkpoint time, and a pinned reader blocks the checkpoint) — but
# the moment the reader releases, the next checkpoint reclaims back to the cap
# instead of leaving the file at its spike high-water mark.

    the WAL to satisfy the read; the symptom that motivated bd-ej995 is the

    out the Docker health check.

# --- Mid-run periodic PASSIVE checkpoint (bd-xjlxj / GH #473) --------------
# DECISION (code-verified, see bead xjlxj): the bead's primary approach
# assumed the ~10s stats poller (BandwidthTracker) holds a pinned read
# transaction across the poll interval, starving the passive auto-checkpoint.
# Reading the poll path disproves that premise — every session in
# ``bandwidth_tracker._collect_stats`` / ``_process_channel_snapshot`` / the
# ``_update_*`` helpers is opened with ``get_session()``, used SYNCHRONOUSLY
# (no ``await`` between open and ``close()``), and closed in a ``finally``.
# The ``asyncio.sleep(poll_interval)`` happens in ``_poll_loop`` with NO
# session held. There is no long read txn to shorten.
#
# The real residual WAL-growth vector on a busy install is FREQUENT
# OVERLAPPING short readers (poll every 10s + HTTP requests + scheduled
# tasks): a PASSIVE auto-checkpoint backs off whenever any reader is mid-WAL-
# frame, so during sustained activity the WAL can drift up toward
# ``journal_size_limit`` and the boot-only TRUNCATE is the only full reset.
#
# This is the bead's documented FALLBACK: a count-based periodic PASSIVE
# checkpoint that gives the checkpointer extra, deliberate attempts to reclaim
# mid-run. PASSIVE — NEVER TRUNCATE — is deliberate: TRUNCATE takes an
# exclusive WAL lock and contends with concurrent readers ('database is
# locked' / write stalls). PASSIVE never blocks readers or writers; it
# reclaims what it can and reports what it couldn't via ``(busy, log,
# checkpointed)``.
#
# Default cadence: every 30 poll cycles. At the default 10s poll interval that
# is ~5 minutes — frequent enough to bound WAL growth between the boot
# truncate windows, infrequent enough to add negligible overhead (one PASSIVE
# checkpoint per 5 min is cheap and contention-free).

    bd-12hxn / GH #473: an M3U digest OOM'd the container (~18.5 GiB) and, under
    the memory/swap pressure, CORRUPTED the on-disk SQLite DB — the run died
    with ``sqlite3.DatabaseError: database disk image is malformed`` raised from
    a ``fetchall`` mid-request. That is a DATA-LOSS class outcome, not just an
    availability one, and it surfaced at a random read instead of at boot. This
    check moves detection to the front door: corruption is caught BEFORE
    migrations or ``create_all`` touch a malformed file (which can deepen the
    damage), and surfaced LOUDLY with operator guidance instead of as a cryptic
    mid-request 500.

    quick_check vs integrity_check — we use ``quick_check`` deliberately:

    * A full ``PRAGMA integrity_check`` walks every index and cross-checks every
      b-tree against its table — on a multi-GB DB that can take many seconds to
      minutes. That is the SAME Docker health-check ``start_period`` risk the
      WAL-truncate comment documents (GH #274): a slow boot step marks the
      container unhealthy and blocks ecm-mcp.
    * ``quick_check`` skips the expensive index-vs-table cross-verification but
      STILL detects the malformed-page / corrupt-b-tree class — exactly the
      "database disk image is malformed" failure GH #473 hit. It is dramatically
      cheaper and bounded enough to run on every boot. The cheaper check catching
      the actual incident's failure mode is the right trade for a boot-path guard.

    Placement (init_db): after the engine is created and after
    ``_wal_checkpoint_truncate`` (so the check sees the post-truncate main-file
    state), but BEFORE ``_bootstrap_alembic`` / ``create_all`` /
    ``_assert_schema_matches_models`` — corruption must be caught before
    migrations try to write to a malformed file.

    In-memory DBs (tests, ``sqlite:///:memory:``) and fresh installs (no file
    yet) are skipped: ``quick_check`` on an empty/absent DB returns ``ok``
    trivially, but skipping the in-memory path keeps the main test suite (which
    runs thousands of in-memory engines) free of an unnecessary per-init scan.

    On a non-'ok' result we follow the bd-zaaey loud-fail philosophy already in
    this file (re-raise on boot problems rather than running for days on a
    silently-broken DB): log a ``[DATABASE]`` ERROR with actionable recovery

    The hand-curated ``_BOOTSTRAP_CANARIES`` list above only covers migrations
    0002 and 0004 — historical artifacts from the bd-fwpzw stamped-at-head
    bug. A user whose ``alembic_version`` row is plausible but whose physical
    schema is missing later-migration columns (e.g. migration 0010's
    ``session_telemetry.stream_id`` — bd-zaaey symptom) sails past the
    canaries and runs forever with a half-broken schema, flooding the logs
    with ``OperationalError: no column named stream_id`` on every poll.

    This check replaces the hand-curated canary list with an automatically-
    derived diff between ``Base.metadata`` (what the running code expects)
    and the live DB (what is actually there). Any future migration's columns
    are covered without extending a canary list per release — the model IS
    the canary list.

    What the check flags:
        - Missing **columns on existing tables** — those are exactly the
          columns an ``ALTER TABLE`` migration is supposed to add, and that
          ``create_all()`` cannot add to an existing table. This is the
          bd-zaaey failure surface.

    What the check deliberately does NOT flag:
        - Missing tables — ``Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`` (called
          right after this function in ``init_db``) handles that idempotently.
        - Extra columns in the DB that aren't on the model — that's a
          downgrade signal, not a missing-migration signal, and not the bug
          this guard is designed to catch.
        - Column type mismatches — SQLite type affinity makes that fuzzy
          enough that a strict diff produces false positives; the migration
          history is the source of truth for type evolution, not this check.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: with a message naming the missing ``table.column``
        pairs so the operator can act without re-running the app under a

    Used by the bd-5w6jz fast-path in ``_bootstrap_alembic``: when
    ``alembic_version`` lags head but the physical schema already matches
    the model shape (because ``Base.metadata.create_all()`` got ahead of
    Alembic on a long-running install), stamp at head and skip the upgrade
    — the migrations would all "already exists"-fail otherwise (or, with
    per-migration idempotency, would all no-op at non-trivial cost).

    Mirrors ``_assert_schema_matches_models``'s column-only diff (no type
    check — SQLite type affinity makes that fuzzy enough to produce false
    positives; the migration history is the source of truth for type
    evolution, not this check). Two key differences:

    * Returns ``bool`` instead of raising. The fast-path needs a yes/no
      decision, not an exception that aborts startup.
    * Also checks for missing tables (``_assert_schema_matches_models``
      delegates that to ``create_all()`` which runs after it). Here we need
      to know whether the live schema covers the model shape — a missing
      table means ``upgrade head`` still has work to do; we must NOT stamp
      forward. ``create_all()`` runs *after* ``_bootstrap_alembic`` so we
      can't rely on it filling the gap before the stamp decision.

    What this check deliberately does NOT flag:

    * Extra columns or tables in the DB that aren't on the model — those
      are downgrade signals or dead-code remnants, not "missing migration"
      signals. The fast-path only cares whether the model shape is a
      subset of the live schema.
    * Index / view / FK presence — column shape is the load-bearing
      surface that the bd-5w6jz failure cluster manifests on. Indexes are
      either re-creatable cheaply or covered by per-migration idempotency
      guards; views are recreated by 0010 every time anyway.
    * Type / nullability mismatches — same SQLite affinity rationale as
      ``_assert_schema_matches_models``.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if every model table and column is present in ``engine``;
        ``False`` if any are missing (in which case ``upgrade head`` should
        run normally to apply pending migrations).

    """Flip cleanup task from MANUAL to CRON Sunday 02:00 UTC for existing operators (bd-ifmr5).

    bd-ygoqr (PR #289) changed the ``CleanupTask`` constructor default from
    ``ScheduleType.MANUAL`` to ``ScheduleType.CRON`` (``0 2 * * 0``) so the
    journal/task-execution/stream_stats retention windows actually enforce
    on fresh installs. But existing installs already have a persisted
    ``scheduled_tasks`` row written at first-boot with ``schedule_type='manual'``,
    and ``task_registry.TaskRegistry.sync_from_database`` faithfully
    rehydrates it — so the bd-ygoqr fix never reaches operators who
    upgraded into v0.17.0, exactly the population GH #243 is about.

    Why not an Alembic migration: ``_bootstrap_alembic``'s bd-5w6jz fast-path
    (see ``_schema_matches_head``) stamps ``alembic_version`` forward to head
    when the live schema already covers the model shape. For every existing
    v0.17.0 install, the ``scheduled_tasks`` table + columns are already
    present, so a regular ALembic data migration would be SILENTLY SKIPPED
    by the fast-path stamp-forward. ``_run_migrations`` runs unconditionally
    every startup and uses WHERE-clause idempotency, which is exactly the
    shape this fix needs.

    Idempotency: the ``schedule_type='manual'`` predicate is the natural gate.
    - Operator already on CRON or INTERVAL: WHERE matches zero rows, no-op.
    - Fresh install (no DB row yet): WHERE matches zero rows, no-op.
    - Already-migrated install (CRON after previous run): WHERE matches
      zero rows, no-op (second startup logs nothing).

    Operator caveat documented in CHANGELOG: an operator who deliberately
    set MANUAL via the UI will be flipped to CRON by this one-time
    migration. They can re-set MANUAL from Settings -> Tasks afterwards.
    The migration assumes MANUAL was the historical default (it was) and
    not an explicit operator choice (it usually wasn't, per GH #243).

    """Flip the auto_creation task MANUAL -> INTERVAL 60s for existing operators
    (ADR-011, bd-ka7j9).

    ADR-011 decoupled M3U refresh from auto-creation: auto-creation is no longer
    hard-chained as a side-effect of the refresh task. Instead the
    ``ChannelPipelineTask`` self-fires on an INTERVAL schedule (~60s) and a top-of-run
    guard runs the post-refresh pipeline only when a new refresh watermark is
    available. The constructor default flipped MANUAL -> INTERVAL (60s), but
    existing installs already have a persisted ``scheduled_tasks`` row with
    ``schedule_type='manual'`` that ``TaskRegistry.sync_from_database`` faithfully
    rehydrates — so the new behavior would never reach upgraders without this
    one-time migration. Mirrors ``_migrate_cleanup_task_manual_to_cron`` (bd-ifmr5),
    including the "why not Alembic" reasoning (the bd-5w6jz fast-path would
    silently skip a data-only Alembic migration).

    We set ``interval_seconds=60`` alongside the type so ``sync_from_database`` /
    ``_create_default_task_schedule`` materialize a ``task_schedules`` row with a
    non-NULL ``next_run_at`` (``calculate_next_run`` returns None for
    interval_seconds <= 0 — the bd-1weac silent-skip trap). ``next_run_at`` is
    reset to NULL on the ``scheduled_tasks`` row so the registry recomputes it.

    Idempotency: the ``schedule_type='manual'`` predicate is the gate — an
    operator already on INTERVAL, a fresh install (no row yet), and a
    previously-migrated install all match zero rows. Operator caveat (CHANGELOG):
    an operator who deliberately set MANUAL via the UI will be flipped to
    INTERVAL once; auto-creation only actually runs when a run_on_refresh rule
    exists and a refresh has occurred, so the practical effect for an operator
    with no run_on_refresh rules is nil.

    Reconciliation with the opt-in model (enhancedchannelmanager-i2xad): this
    flip changes the schedule TYPE only and never sets ``enabled``. The
    corrective ``_migrate_disable_auto_creation_schedule`` runs immediately after
    it in ``_run_migrations`` and disables the PARENT task, so the settled
    end-state on an upgrading instance is an interval/60s child schedule with the
    task DISABLED. There is no window where the task is enabled+interval (both
    run before the task engine arms).

def _migrate_disable_auto_creation_schedule(conn) -> None:
    """Disable the auto_creation TASK ONCE on upgrade (incident i2xad).

    ADR-011 Phase 2 (bd-ka7j9) shipped auto-creation as a self-firing ~60s
    INTERVAL task seeded ENABLED, plus ``_migrate_auto_creation_task_manual_to_interval``
    (above) which flips an existing install's persisted ``scheduled_tasks`` row
    ``manual -> interval`` and leaves it ENABLED. The net effect on upgrade was
    that auto-creation began firing autonomously on every instance — the
    production incident this migration corrects (enhancedchannelmanager-i2xad).

    PO decision: scheduled auto-creation is now OPT-IN (disabled by default), and
    already-flipped-and-enabled instances are auto-corrected on upgrade by
    disabling auto-creation once. The PO has ACCEPTED that this also disables it
    for an operator who *deliberately* enabled it — we cannot reliably
    distinguish a deliberate enable from the migration-driven enable, so the
    disable is unconditional. Operators re-opt-in via the UI, which persists
    (this one-time migration does not re-run — see the marker).

    WHAT IS DISABLED — the PARENT task row only (``scheduled_tasks.enabled=0``),
    NOT the child ``task_schedules`` cadence row. task_engine gates firing on
    BOTH the child schedule's ``enabled`` AND the parent task's ``enabled``, so
    disabling the parent alone fully stops autonomous firing. We deliberately
    LEAVE the child schedule enabled so that opt-in is a single operator action:
    the prominent "Enabled" task toggle (UI list + editor → ``PATCH /api/tasks/{id}``)
    flips the parent, and with the child already enabled the task then fires on
    its 60s cadence. Disabling the child too would make that toggle a no-op
    trap — the task would read "Enabled" yet never run (the child stays off and
    the engine's child-``enabled`` filter excludes it).

    Why ``_run_migrations`` and not Alembic: the bd-5w6jz smart-bootstrap
    fast-path stamps ``alembic_version`` forward to head when the live schema
    already covers the model shape. A *data-only* Alembic migration adds no
    schema, so on every already-flipped install (the exact population we must
    fix) the fast-path would stamp past it WITHOUT running its DML — silently
    skipping the correction. ``_run_migrations`` runs unconditionally every
    startup, which is what this fix needs. This is the same reasoning recorded
    for the sibling flip migration and in ADR-011 §D2.

    One-time gate: because ``_run_migrations`` runs on EVERY startup, an
    unconditional disable would re-stomp an operator who later re-enabled
    auto-creation (breaking opt-in). A persisted marker row in
    ``ecm_oneshot_migrations`` makes the disable run exactly once, reproducing
    Alembic's once-only semantics in the ``_run_migrations`` path. The marker
    table is deliberately NOT a SQLAlchemy model: it is internal migration
    bookkeeping, never read by the app, and kept out of ``Base.metadata`` so the
    Alembic drift test / autogenerate ignore it. (A future engineer running
    ``alembic revision --autogenerate`` against a live DB will see a spurious
    ``drop_table('ecm_oneshot_migrations')`` suggestion — hand-review removes it,
    per ``docs/database_migrations.md``.)

    Idempotency / safety: the marker short-circuits every call after the first;
    the disable is a WHERE-gated UPDATE (no-op when no auto_creation row exists
    or it is already disabled); a missing ``scheduled_tasks`` table is tolerated
    by deferring (no marker written) so a fresh install applies it once the table
    exists. Touches ONLY ``task_id='auto_creation'`` — no other task is affected.

def _heal_task_schedules_null_next_run_at(conn) -> None:
    """Repair task_schedules rows that have ``next_run_at IS NULL`` for an enabled schedule (bd-1weac).

    Background — bd-p5b8i / bd-1weac:

    ``task_registry.TaskRegistry._create_default_task_schedule`` (added
    v0.8.7-0023, 2026-01-29) miscompiled CRON-default tasks: when the
    in-memory ``ScheduleConfig`` was ``ScheduleType.CRON``, the function
    fell through to a default branch that wrote
    ``schedule_type='interval', interval_seconds=0`` into ``task_schedules``.
    ``schedule_calculator.calculate_next_run`` returns ``None`` for
    ``interval_seconds <= 0`` (see ``_calculate_interval_next_run``), so the
    row's ``next_run_at`` column was ``NULL`` from the moment it was written.
    ``task_engine.check_and_run_tasks`` filters
    ``WHERE next_run_at IS NOT NULL`` (see ``TaskEngine.check_and_run_tasks``),
    so the row exists in the DB, shows up in the Settings → Tasks UI, but
    never fires. For 4 months, every operator who restarted ECM between
    v0.8.7-0023 and v0.17.0-0042 has at least one such row — CleanupTask
    after bd-ygoqr flipped its default to CRON, StatsV2RollupTask since it
    landed with a daily-03:30 CRON default.

    The Part 1 fix (bd-1weac, this commit) repairs the WRITE path so new
    rows never end up broken. This Part 2 heal scans for pre-existing broken
    rows and rewrites them in place. We have to heal in ``_run_migrations``
    rather than via Alembic because the bd-5w6jz smart-bootstrap fast-path
    (see ``_schema_matches_head``) stamps ``alembic_version`` forward to head
    when the live schema covers the model shape — an Alembic data migration
    would be SILENTLY SKIPPED on every existing v0.17.0 install (this is
    the same constraint that drove bd-ifmr5's choice).

    Heal logic:
    1. Filter: ``next_run_at IS NULL AND enabled = 1``. Disabled rows are
       NULL by design; we leave them. MANUAL tasks don't get a
       ``task_schedules`` row at all (per the
       ``ScheduleType.MANUAL`` guard in
       ``TaskRegistry.sync_from_database``), so they can't end up in this
       code path.
    2. Look up the task's registered class via the registry. If the row's
       current schedule_type is the broken default (``interval`` with
       ``interval_seconds=0``), rewrite the schedule columns from the task
       class's ``schedule_config``. If the row carries an operator-customised
       schedule (e.g., ``daily 06:30 America/New_York``), preserve the
       columns and only recompute ``next_run_at``.
    3. Compute ``next_run_at`` via ``schedule_calculator.calculate_next_run``
       and UPDATE the row.

    Idempotency: a healed row has ``next_run_at`` set, so subsequent calls
    find zero rows matching the NULL predicate and log nothing. The
    operator-visible log fires ONLY on first heal — every container restart
    after that is silent.

    Operator-visible: a single INFO log per call when N > 0, referencing
    bd-1weac for traceability. No logs when nothing to heal.

    """Point a stored dummy EPG tvg-id template at the channel id.

    The ``tvg_id_template`` code default moved from ``ecm-{channel_number}`` to
    ``ecm-{channel_id}``, but a SQLAlchemy ``default=`` applies at INSERT only,
    so a profile row written before that change still holds the old string and
    ``dummy_epg_engine`` renders ``ecm-<number>`` from it. Channel numbers are
    handed out from 1 again whenever channels are rebuilt, so a number-keyed
    guide row attaches the previous holder's programmes to whatever event now
    carries that number. Channel ids are never reissued.

    What the rewrite leaves behind: a channel whose ``epg_data_id`` already
    points at an ``ecm-<number>`` guide row shows no programmes until the next
    EPG match pass moves it onto the id-keyed row.

    Why not Alembic: ``_bootstrap_alembic``'s bd-5w6jz fast-path (see
    ``_schema_matches_head``) stamps ``alembic_version`` forward to head when
    the live schema already covers the model shape. ``tvg_id_template`` has
    existed since the baseline, so every install carrying the old value is
    exactly the population that fast-path skips, and a data-only Alembic
    revision would never execute there. ``_run_migrations`` runs unconditionally
    every startup and relies on WHERE-clause idempotency, which is the shape
    this fix needs.

    Idempotency: the exact-literal predicate is the gate. A fresh install, an
    already-migrated install, and a profile an operator has edited to anything
    else all match zero rows, so a customised template is left alone.
