EPG Matching Module

Provides functions for matching channels to EPG (Electronic Program Guide) data.
Ported from frontend/src/services/epgMatching.ts.

Key capabilities:
- Batch EPG matching with confidence scoring
- League prefix extraction and matching
- Broadcast call sign detection (K/W stations)
- Country-aware matching from stream metadata
- TVG-ID parsing for structured EPG lookups
- Multi-word EPG search

# An "acronym" candidate comes from an EXACT dict-key lookup against a
# parenthetical abbreviation Dispatcharr embeds in the tvg_id (and sometimes
# the display name) — e.g. "OWN" resolves via OprahWinfreyNetwork(OWN).us,
# "HGTV" via Home&GardenTelevision(HGTV).us. This is NOT a fuzzy/partial
# signal like "prefix" (15pts): the acronym is the deliberate, canonical
# short identifier for the network, and the lookup matches it exactly, not
# via a substring guess. It is therefore weighted EQUAL to "exact" (25pts)
# rather than below it — matching the acronym carries the same certainty as
# matching the full flattened name/tvg_id, just through a different (and,
# for channels literally named after the acronym, e.g. "890 | Fetv", the
# ONLY working) field.
#
# It is deliberately NOT weighted ABOVE "exact": a full name/tvg_id match
# remains the most complete identity signal when it is available; acronym
# matching only kicks in as an alternate discovery path when the flattened
# name/tvg_id blob buries the acronym mid-string where no boundary check can
# find it (see parse_tvg_id / epg_match_key). build_epg_lookup folds the
# extracted acronym into the entry's match_tokens set, so when multiple
# candidates share the same acronym (e.g. HGTV entries from several
# countries), the token-overlap term below still discriminates between them
# via the surrounding network-name tokens (and, when stream data is
# available, country/league +40 discriminates further).

# --- Channel-tvg_id identity weight -------------------------------------
# The channel's OWN tvg_id matching the EPG entry's tvg_id is the only place a
# tvg_id says which entry this channel wants. Everything else a tvg_id
# contributes is indirect (a country suffix, a parenthetical acronym, an
# alternate name key), so this is the one signal that deserves score. Weighted
# equal to "exact" (25) because it carries the same certainty as matching the
# full flattened name, and deliberately NOT above the country/league tier: a
# stale tvg_id left on a channel by an earlier link should not be able to
# outweigh every other signal at once.

    engine-less path). Subchannel markers and generic format words are dropped
    so the overlap reflects real network/affiliate/city identity, not noise.

    A standalone digit-run token is fused onto the immediately preceding
    token (e.g. ["espn", "2"] -> ["espn2"]) before the drop filters run
    (bd-gl3sd). Without this, a spaced channel name like "ESPN 2" and its
    fused EPG counterpart "ESPN2" — which already collapse to the IDENTICAL
    match key via epg_match_key's flatten-and-strip — produce disjoint token
    sets ({"espn"} vs {"espn2"}), because the lone digit "2" is dropped by
    the length filter while "espn2" survives whole. That let a coincidental
    "ESPN HD" prefix match outscore the correct "ESPN2" exact match on the
    token-overlap term alone. The fuse is intentionally conservative:
    - Only merges into the RAW previous token (not an already-fused one), so
      two independent digit runs ("Channel 4 +1" -> "4", "1") never get
      glued into one bogus number ("channel41").
    - Skips fusing onto a stopword or subchannel-marker predecessor ("dt",
      "hd", ...), so "WUNC-DT 20 (PBS)" keeps dropping "dt" and "20"
      independently exactly as before, and "Eurosport 360 HD 8" doesn't let
      "8" smuggle through fused to "hd" as "hd8" (which would evade both the

    4. Raw confidence (higher first, within band + source)
    5. Subchannel number (m4hp1: primary feed before diginet) — a pure
       tie-break, applied only AFTER token-quality/confidence already tied, so
       it never beats a genuinely higher-overlap candidate (e.g. won't let
       KCOP-DT beat a real KCOP-DT4 (MY) MyNet diginet match).
    6. Exact over prefix (for names > 2 chars)
    7. Special punctuation match
    8. Channel-is-prefix-of-EPG preferred
    9. Region consistency (vznut.2): channel region == EPG region preferred;
       band-preserving, replaces the latently-backwards ``has_regional``
       tie-break. Inert when the channel has no detected region.
    10. Alphabetical, then EPG id (fully deterministic)

    The former name-length-similarity tie-break (``len_diff``) was REMOVED
    (m4hp1): like the length term in _compute_confidence, it rewarded
    coincidental character counts and mis-ranked noisier subchannels over the
    clean primary feed. Token-set quality (confidence) plus the subchannel
    tie-break replace it.

    ``source_order`` maps EPG ``source_id -> rank`` (0 = most preferred). It is a
    *banded tiebreaker*: it only reorders candidates that share a confidence
    band, so it never promotes a candidate more than one band worse on
    confidence. When ``source_order`` is None/empty every match gets an equal
    rank, and because the band is a monotonic function of confidence the result
    is identical to ordering by raw confidence alone (no behavior change).
