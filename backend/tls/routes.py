TLS API endpoints for certificate management.

Provides REST endpoints for:
- TLS configuration status
- Let's Encrypt certificate issuance (DNS-01 challenge)
- Manual certificate upload
- Certificate renewal

AUTHORIZATION (bead 9kwzp.11)
-----------------------------

This router carried NO route-level dependency on any of its thirteen routes.
The global ``auth_middleware`` in main.py establishes only that the caller is
authenticated (no ``/api/tls`` path is or was in ``AUTH_EXEMPT_PATHS``), so
every route was reachable by any authenticated non-admin AND by the static MCP
service principal, which ``auth.dependencies._build_mcp_service_principal``
stamps ``is_admin=True``. Three tiers now apply, per route:

* ``RequireHumanAdminForTLSMaterial`` — the certificate/key material and
  HTTPS-termination lifecycle, plus the settings read that emits masked DNS
  credentials. Admin required and the MCP principal refused.
* ``RequireHumanAdminForOutboundTest`` — ``POST /test-dns-provider`` only. It
  hands DNS credentials to the provider API and reports the upstream verdict
  back, which is the credential-oracle class of beads i4qrp / 9kwzp.6 /
  9kwzp.7, and its 403 body already names that shape.
* ``RequireAdminIfEnabled`` — the two status reads, which disclose no
  credential material. Admin required, MCP principal admitted, which is the
  inventory's default for anything outside the denied classes.

AUTH-DISABLED BEHAVIOUR (beads jy006 and 2u4e0, PO decisions 2026-08-13 and
2026-08-15)
------------------------------------------------------------

This paragraph used to read "all three no-op when ``require_auth`` is false or
setup is incomplete". That is now true of only the third tier.

* ``RequireHumanAdminForTLSMaterial`` carries ``enforce_when_auth_disabled``.
  On an instance that HAS an operator identity (a user row, or
  ``setup_complete``), all ten of its routes require a real human admin even
  while ``require_auth`` is false. Installing a caller-supplied private key is
  one of the identity primitives ECM refuses anonymously in every mode, because
  the installed key becomes the instance's TLS identity and survives the
  operator turning authentication back on. On an instance with NO operator
  identity — a genuine first run, or a deliberately headless auth-disabled
  deployment that never created a user — the gate still no-ops, so nothing is
  locked out.
* ``RequireHumanAdminForOutboundTest`` (``POST /test-dns-provider``) carries it
  too, since bead 2u4e0. jy006 had left this one route open because its
  decision named only the identity primitives and this gate carries eleven
  siblings in other routers, and the residual made this router contradict
  itself: ``GET /settings`` was refused on an owned auth-disabled instance
  while ``POST /test-dns-provider``, which SPENDS the DNS-provider credentials
  that route discloses in masked form, was not. The PO closed the whole family
  on the credential-oracle axis. The same no-identity carve-out applies.
* ``RequireAdminIfEnabled`` (the two status reads) is UNCHANGED: it still
  no-ops whenever ``require_auth`` is false or setup is incomplete. Those reads
  disclose no credential material.

Every verdict is pinned in ``tests/test_admin_gate_inventory.py``,
``tests/routers/test_9kwzp11_tls_router_admin_gate.py`` and
``tests/routers/test_jy006_auth_disabled_identity_primitives.py``.

    Bead 04c0u.9 remediation, stated as an invariant rather than as the route
    that first demonstrated it: NO session that predates TLS termination
    survives it, by ANY activation route. Without that, a jar holding a
    PRE-activation, non-``Secure`` ``refresh_token`` keeps that token valid for
    the remaining 7 days, and a token captured in cleartext before activation is
    replayable against the brand-new HTTPS listener and can be rotated forward
    indefinitely. Signing in once over HTTPS overwrites the pair, so this bites
    exactly the operator who bookmarked the HTTP port and never revisits over
    HTTPS. Revocation is the only control against pre-activation capture:
    ``auth.routes._require_secure_session_transport`` closes the HTTP port to
    NEW sessions, not to ones already minted.

    Callers pass ``was_terminating`` captured BEFORE they touched settings or
    key material; this rereads the predicate after. Four routes can move it:
    ``/configure`` (flips ``enabled``), ``/request-cert`` and
    ``/complete-challenge`` (land the certificate an already-``enabled``
    instance was waiting for), ``/upload-cert`` (does both at once) and
    ``/renew`` (issues a first certificate if none exists). The background
    renewal task cannot: ``tls/renewal.py::check_and_renew_certificate``
    returns early on ``not storage.has_certificate()``, so it can only replace
    a certificate on an instance that is already terminating TLS.

    ``auth_epoch`` is bumped as well as the rows revoked: the row revocation
    kills the refresh token, the epoch bump kills the up-to-30-minute access
    token already minted and sitting in the same jar. Returns the operator
