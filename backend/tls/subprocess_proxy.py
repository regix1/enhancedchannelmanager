"""HTTPS-subprocess -> main-process proxy for the lock-participating write paths.

GH #720 Part B (PO decision: MAIN IS THE SOLE WRITER OF THE AUTO-SYNC RECONCILE).
In TLS mode a second request-serving ``uvicorn main:app`` subprocess (env
``ECM_HTTPS_SUBPROCESS=1``) can serve requests, while the monitor sweep + the
scheduler run only in the main process. So a request that triggers the auto-sync
reconcile / an ``assign_channel_profile`` pipeline write, or that runs a
background task, could execute in the subprocess and race the main process — and
the IN-PROCESS per-effective-group lock (and the per-process task engine) would
not coordinate across the two processes.

This middleware — active ONLY in the HTTPS subprocess — forwards the small,
explicit allowlist of those routes to the MAIN process's local HTTP port and
relays the response verbatim, so the LOCK-PARTICIPATING writes (the group-
settings save's cascade + reconcile, the channel-pipeline / auto-creation run,
the post-refresh sweep) and ALL background task runs execute ONLY in the main
process, where the lock + scheduler are authoritative. Every other route is
served locally, unchanged.

SCOPE (honest): this covers the AUTO-SYNC RECONCILE + ``assign_channel_profile``
pipeline paths (the ones that participate in ``_group_locks``) and background
task runs — NOT every channel-profile membership write. The DIRECT membership-
edit endpoints (``PATCH /api/channel-profiles/{id}/channels[/bulk-update]``) are
a SEPARATE, PRE-EXISTING concern: they never participated in ``_group_locks``
(even in main they run unlocked), so forwarding them would be theater. They are
tracked in bead nq3ed, not addressed here.

Security: hard-coded target (127.0.0.1 + the main HTTP port), an exact
method+path allowlist (JSON routes only — no streaming, no websockets, no open
proxy), and a plain header/body pass-through (auth headers preserved). No proxy
timeout ceiling is imposed — the MAIN process's own request-timeout middleware
is authoritative (it 504s non-exempt routes and exempts long-running task runs),
so the proxy must NOT cut a legitimately long task run to a 502.
