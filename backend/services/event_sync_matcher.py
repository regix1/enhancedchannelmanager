"""
Event sync matcher service — parse → time-block → parsed-title scoring
(bead enhancedchannelmanager-ti939.1.1, epic ti939 "Event Sync").

Matches SECONDARY-provider event streams to MASTER-group channels for the
event_sync feature: one channel per real-world live event, with every
provider's stream attached. Same event, different provider spellings —
slot prefixes ("Peacock 14:", "Fubo Sports Network 07 :"), team
abbreviations (Man United / MUFC / Manchester United), and two observed
date shapes ("11 Jul 06:00 PM ET" day-first, "Jan 17 02:45 PM ET"
month-first).

**Pure module.** No imports from channel_pipeline_engine or
channel_pipeline_executor (same isolation pattern as
services/dedup_matcher.py). The Phase 1A preview endpoint and the Phase 1B
attach resolver both call this exact code path — dry-run parity by
construction.

Layered matching (in order):

1. **Parse** — stream/channel name → (event title, start datetime), reusing
   the dummy-EPG machinery (``extract_groups`` / ``compute_event_times``,
   which route operator-authored patterns through ``safe_regex`` against
   untrusted provider strings). A name with no complete parsed date+time is
   UNMATCHABLE — the start time is never guessed from "now" (that guess is
   dummy-EPG behavior this module deliberately does not inherit). Derived
   titles are length-capped before they leave the module.
2. **Time-window blocking** — candidate pairs only when parsed start times
   are within ±``window_minutes`` (default 30). This is candidate
   *generation*, not a safety rail.
3. **Fuzzy score of PARSED TITLES** (never raw names) — RapidFuzz
   ``token_set_ratio`` on LOCALS-cleaned strings via the shared cleaner in
   services/dedup_matcher.py.
4. **Team-token check** — split the title on vs / v. / @, compare the two
   sides order-insensitively. A token CONFLICT (both titles parse to team
   pairs and the pairs clearly differ, including gender/age-qualifier
   mismatches like "W" / "U21") is a HARD REJECT: score 0.0, mirroring the
   M1 callsign hard-reject rail. Token agreement raises confidence.
5. **Event admission policy** — :func:`is_event_attachable`, gated by its
   OWN floor constant :data:`EVENT_ATTACH_FLOOR` (0.80 default, per-rule
   adjustable — operator-authoritative, may be lowered). Deliberately NOT the dedup matcher's
   admission policy — two different risk profiles must never share one knob.

**Identity contract.** Master channels are identified by NAME / parsed
identity only. This module never sees, caches, or returns channel IDs —
master channels are Dispatcharr-owned and their IDs must be re-resolved by
the caller on every run (PO decision: stateless recompute).

The frozen regression corpus
(``tests/fixtures/event_sync/matcher_corpus.jsonl``) gates this module's
precision/recall in CI — see ``tests/test_event_sync_matcher_corpus.py``.

#
# Title: strip an optional SLOT prefix, then capture everything up to the
# "@ <date>" delimiter.
#
# Slot-prefix shape (PR #611 review, finding 4): anchored, bounded
# (≤ 40 chars, no ':' or '@' inside), ending in an EXACTLY-two-digit slot
# number + colon — every live-observed slot list is zero-padded to two
# digits ("Peacock 14:", "Fubo Sports Network 07 :", "NFL Game Pass 01:").
# The bound deliberately does NOT strip series-identity prefixes like
# "UFC 317:" / "Bellator 300:" (3 digits, guarded by the (?<!\d)
# lookbehind) or "Formula 1:" (1 digit) — those are part of the event
# identity; the old greedy any-digits strip collapsed "UFC 317: Early
# Prelims" and "Bellator 300: Early Prelims" to the same title. Residual
# risk (PR #611 review nit — empirically verified): a provider using
# unpadded 1-digit or 3-digit slot numbers keeps its slot prefix inside the
# parsed title, where it rides into the team-token split. When BOTH sides
# retain such prefixes ("Peacock 5: Lyon vs. Marseille" / "Fubo 3 : Lyon
# vs. Marseille") the provider tokens land on opposite team sides and the
# pair HARD team-token-CONFLICTS (score 0.0) — a SILENT FALSE NEGATIVE,
# not graceful degradation. One-sided retention only dilutes the fuzzy
# score. The escape hatch for such providers is a per-rule pattern
# override (event_sync_config.patterns / group_patterns).
#
# Date-delimiter "@"/"|" vs team-separator "@" (PR #611 review, finding 2;
# broadened for the live "|"-delimited + trailing-suffix shapes, bead
# 9c9j7): a title may itself contain "@" as a home/away separator ("Rangers
# @ Islanders @ 11 Jul 07:00 PM ET"), so the title capture is ".+?" bounded
# by an explicitly DATE-SHAPED tail — the delimiter followed by
# "<day> <month> <h:mm>" or "<month> <day> [year] <h:mm>" — not by the
# first delimiter in the name. A team-separator can never satisfy the date
# shape (it is never followed by "<h:mm>" immediately after the day/month
# tokens), so the title extends through it.
#
# Three broadenings over the original "@ <date> <time>$" shape, each driven
# by live provider names that were producing "Incomplete date/time" parse
# FAILURES (bead 9c9j7):
#   1. TRAILING SUFFIX after the time — a slot/provider label the provider
#      appends AFTER the date ("... @ Jul 11 9:30 AM :Flo Racing 03",
#      "... | Sun 12 Jul 02:00 EDT (US) | | US: ESPN+ PPV 40"). Fixed by
#      folding the CAPTURED time into the date pattern (``_TIME_CAPTURE``)
#      so hour/minute are positionally locked to the date and the pattern
#      stops at the timezone instead of having to reach end-of-string.
#   2. "|" DELIMITER as well as "@" (``_DATE_DELIM``), for pipe-delimited
#      listing formats.
#   3. Optional leading WEEKDAY token before the date (``_WEEKDAY_PREFIX``),
#      e.g. "| Sun 12 Jul 02:00 EDT". Weekday abbreviations never collide
#      with month abbreviations, so this is unambiguous before either shape.

    time-window block (masters whose parsed start is within
    ±``window_minutes``); each candidate is scored and banded, ordered
    best-first (score desc, then master name asc for determinism).

    ``patterns`` parses the secondary stream names; ``master_patterns``
    (when given) parses the master names instead of ``patterns`` — the
    per-group pattern override surface (event_sync_config.group_patterns,
    bead ti939.1.4): a master group and a secondary group may ship
    different name shapes, and parsing masters with the secondary group's
    override would silently fail or mis-title them. ``None`` keeps the
    original behavior (both sides share ``patterns``).

    Masters are identified by NAME only — the caller re-resolves channel
    IDs against Dispatcharr on every run.

    ``team_aliases`` (bead ti939.4.2): operator alias groups, built into
    ONE index for the whole call. ``None`` (every production caller) loads
    the instance-wide dictionary from the settings store — attach run,
    preview, and debug bundle therefore share one dictionary by
    construction; pass ``()`` or fixture groups in tests.
