"""Event Sync pre-flight checks (bead enhancedchannelmanager-ti939.1.3).

Verifies the Dispatcharr-side preconditions of an event_sync rule BEFORE a
preview (Phase 1A) or run (Phase 1B) executes:

* the MASTER group has ``auto_channel_sync`` **ON** — Dispatcharr owns the
  master channels' lifecycle; with auto-sync off no master channels exist
  and the whole feature silently matches nothing, so this must surface as
  an explicit failure in results rather than an empty preview;
* every SECONDARY group has ``auto_channel_sync`` **OFF** — a secondary
  with auto-sync on means Dispatcharr is creating duplicate channels from
  a group that event_sync treats as a pure stream source.

**READ-ONLY by contract.** This module inspects group settings via the
Dispatcharr client's ``get_all_m3u_group_settings()`` and must NEVER write
or toggle any Dispatcharr setting — guided toggles are a Phase 2 operator
convenience (epic ti939.3), and even then they are explicit operator
actions, never a side effect of a check. Unit tests pin this with a
client mock exposing only the read method.

Known edge (documented, not coded around): Dispatcharr channel groups are
GLOBAL BY NAME (bd-dgs64, config.py ~L104-117). ``get_all_m3u_group_settings``
collapses per-account settings to one entry per group ID, preferring an
entry with ``auto_channel_sync`` enabled — so a secondary group whose NAME
is also auto-synced by another account reads as auto_channel_sync ON here
and fails the secondary check. That is the correct surface: ANY account
auto-syncing that group ID means Dispatcharr is creating channels from it.
Real event groups are provider-distinct-named.
