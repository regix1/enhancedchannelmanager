"""
Stream-name staleness signal for Event Sync's ``assume_current_date`` rail
(bead enhancedchannelmanager-jqwfq).

The field-reported failure: a provider leaves YESTERDAY's dateless slot name
("FURY vs HALL 6PM") in the M3U; ``assume_current_date`` synthesizes TODAY's
date at that clock time; identical title + tiny time delta scores 1.0 and the
stream attaches to the WRONG master. Undecidable from the name alone — the
missing fact is *when this exact name was first seen*.

Dispatcharr's per-stream timestamps cannot answer that (``updated_at`` /
``last_seen`` are bumped for EVERY stream on every refresh — refresh
liveness, not name freshness; spike finding on this bead). The one cheap
source that can is :class:`models.M3USnapshot`: the M3U change monitor
persists full per-group stream-name lists ~2x daily. A stream name is
**stale-suspect** when it already appears in the most recent snapshot of its
M3U account taken BEFORE local midnight today (``DEFAULT_EVENT_TIMEZONE`` —
the same anchor ``parse_event_name`` places dateless times on, so "today"
means the same day on both sides).

FAIL OPEN by construction. Snapshot capture has two known blind spots —
stream names are captured for ENABLED groups only, and each group's list is
capped at ``tasks.m3u_refresh.MAX_STREAM_NAMES`` (mirrored here as
:data:`SNAPSHOT_MAX_STREAM_NAMES`) — so ABSENCE from a snapshot is
inconclusive and maps to ``None`` (unknown), never ``False``-as-proof.
Positive membership is the only definitive answer: the cap can cause missed
detections, never false staleness.

Pure sync module: one DB read, no Dispatcharr client, no engine imports.
Async callers (the preview router / pipeline engine) run
:func:`previous_day_names` via ``run_in_threadpool``.
