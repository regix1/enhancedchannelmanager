"""Per-channel media-server attribution reconciliation (bd-mlcla).

This module replaces the brittle per-IP gate + per-IP broadcast that the
three media-server resolvers and their two call sites used to do. The old
model assumed every media-server-mediated Dispatcharr connection egressed
through the configured media-server IP, so it gated on
``ecm_session_ip == <source>_server_ip`` and broadcast a single resolver
hit to every connection. Both assumptions break under Docker networking:

* **Gate brittleness (bd-mlcla / bd-podx3 incident):** browser-direct
  playback (e.g. Jellyfin Web) is NAT'd through the media box's Docker
  bridge gateway, so ECM observes source ``172.18.0.1`` instead of the
  configured ``172.16.0.19``. The strict gate rejected it → "User #0".
* **Broadcast collapse (bd-ost8o):** matching ECM clients to sessions by
  channel name alone, with no per-connection identity, collapsed every
  viewer on a channel onto one media-server user.
* **Broadcast fan-out (bd-cat70):** stamping one resolver hit onto every
  connection broadcast one user to all clients.

The unlock: Dispatcharr ``/proxy/ts/status`` connections carry a stable
unique ``client_id``; media-server sessions carry a stable ``session_id``
+ ``user_name`` + ``last_activity_date``. The two sides' **source IPs do
NOT correlate** across the NAT boundary, so attribution cannot be an IP
join. Instead it is a per-channel **set reconciliation**:

* **Eligible connections** = Dispatcharr connections on the channel with
  no per-client identity. The LIVE discriminator is the Dispatcharr
  ACCOUNT identity (``has_account_identity``, bd-rools): a connection with
  a positive ``user_id`` is a genuine direct-IPTV subscriber, keeps the
  bd-gy5nd provider/hostname attribution path, and is excluded here. The
  original "no-URL-identity" discriminator (``has_url_identity`` /
  :func:`url_embeds_username`) is RETAINED-BUT-NOT-WIRED (bd-4w9w6 /
  bd-spzeu): it is always ``False`` in production because the only URL
  available at the call sites is the channel's SHARED upstream provider
  URL, not a per-client signal. It is kept as dormant scaffolding for a
  future per-client credentialed-URL signal, not deleted.
* **Candidate users** = the distinct media-server users the resolvers
  matched to the channel.
* **Assignment** = each user assigned to AT MOST ONE connection
  (structural anti-collapse). Connections ranked by IP-priority then
  ``connected_at``; users ranked by ``last_activity_date`` descending;
  paired 1:1.

Source IP is used ONLY to RANK connections (trusted/infrastructure IPs
sort first as most-likely media-mediated). It NEVER rejects: getting the
ranking wrong can only change tie-break order, never correctness.

Residual ambiguity (PO decision = Option B): when a group of connections
is genuinely indistinguishable (same IP-priority bucket, no per-connection
signal to order them) AND there are 2+ candidate users for that group, do
NOT pin a single possibly-wrong name to each row. Instead label each
connection in the ambiguous group with a rollup
``"N viewers: <comma-separated distinct user list>"``. See
:func:`reconcile_channel` and :data:`AMBIGUOUS_GROUP_PREDICATE` for the
exact predicate.

        client_id: Stable unique per-connection id from Dispatcharr (e.g.
            ``"client_1779287570260_1682"``). The reconciler keys its
            per-connection assignment output on this id so the caller can
            map results back to the right client dict. Falls back to
            ``ip_address`` when Dispatcharr omits it (older payloads),
            which is still stable enough for one poll's reconciliation.
        ip_address: Source IP ECM observed for this connection. Used ONLY
            for ranking (priority bucket); never to gate.
        connected_at: Unix-epoch float (or comparable) of when the
            connection started. Secondary sort key after IP priority so
            the longest-connected viewer in a bucket sorts first. ``None``
            sorts last.

            via the bd-gy5nd provider/hostname path. Connections with a

            **bd-4w9w6 / bd-rools — RETAINED-BUT-NOT-WIRED (bd-spzeu):** the
            call sites no longer derive this from the channel's shared upstream

            :func:`url_embeds_username`). Do NOT delete it as dead code; it is
            dormant scaffolding awaiting a per-client URL identity signal that
            Dispatcharr ``/proxy/ts/status`` does not currently provide.
        has_account_identity: True when this connection carries a genuine
            Dispatcharr ACCOUNT identity — a positive ``user_id`` (and/or a
            non-empty ``username``) on the Dispatcharr ``/proxy/ts/status``
            client dict, i.e. the viewer authenticated to Dispatcharr with
            a real sub-account (e.g. ``kmfelmer``, ``user_id=3``). Such a
            connection is a genuine direct-IPTV subscriber whose attribution
            comes from its Dispatcharr account (bd-gy5nd path), NOT from a
            media-server session.

            **bd-rools (re-fix for bd-cat70 direct-client cross-attribution):**
            Dispatcharr surfaces ``user_id == "0"`` / ``0`` / ``None`` for
            an ANONYMOUS connection — every media-server pull (transcoding
            proxy AND NAT'd browser-direct playback) is anonymous to
            Dispatcharr and therefore has NO account identity, so it stays
            eligible. A connection WITH an account identity is EXCLUDED from
            reconciliation by :func:`eligible_connections` (so a real
            subscriber on a channel shared with a media-server viewer can
            never absorb that viewer via the B1 direct-first ordering) and
            is never treated as the server proxy. Verified against live
            Dispatcharr data (the active media-server pull carries
            ``user_id="0"``; sub-accounts carry positive ids).
        is_server_proxy: True when this connection's source IP IS a resolved
            media-server IP — i.e. it is the media server's own transcoding
            proxy pull, which legitimately carries the channel's upstream
            viewers on one Dispatcharr connection (the bd-r5f0c.9
            multi-viewer-on-one-proxy case).

            **bd-mlcla B1 ordering:** the at-most-once 1:1 assignment runs
            on the DIRECT (non-proxy) connections FIRST, consuming distinct
            users; the server-proxy connection then carries only the
            REMAINING (unconsumed) users as its rollup. This guarantees a
            browser-direct viewer sharing a channel with a proxy pull always
            gets its own distinct name whenever an unconsumed matching user
            exists — the proxy never suppresses it to User #0.

            **Exact-IP-equality assumption (mis-fire edge):** this flag is
            set by the call sites as ``source_ip == resolved_server_ip`` with
            NO corroborating signal (no user-agent check, no session
            cross-reference). A browser-direct connection whose observed
            source IP happens to equal the configured server IP (e.g. the
            operator runs the browser on the media-server host itself) is
            therefore mis-flagged as the proxy. The B1 direct-first ordering
            bounds the blast radius: even when mis-flagged, distinct direct
            viewers on the channel are reconciled first, so the mis-flagged
            connection carries only the leftover set rather than swallowing
            everyone. The mis-fire can still mislabel that one connection's
            display (proxy rollup vs. single name); a corroborating signal is
            tracked as future work, not gated here.

    """Reconcile one channel's eligible connections against its candidate users.

    Implements the four PO constraints structurally:

    1. **Networking-agnostic.** Source IP is read only via
       :func:`ip_priority` to rank groups; it never excludes a
       connection. Host IP, container IP, bridge gateway, NAT'd source,
       and the configured server IP all reach the same assignment — only
       tie-break order can differ.
    2. **Anti-collapse.** Each candidate user is consumed AT MOST ONCE
       (popped from the ranked user list as it is assigned), so one user
       can never land on two connections in a single poll.
    3. **Anti-broadcast.** Assignment is per-connection (a user is paired
       to one ``client_id``); there is no path that stamps one user onto
       every connection.
    4. **No phantom clients.** When ``users > connections`` the surplus
       users appear only in :attr:`ReconciliationResult.channel_viewers`,
       never as a synthesized connection.

    Count behavior:

    * ``users == connections`` → exact 1:1 by rank.
    * ``users < connections`` → fill the top-ranked connections; the
      remainder stay User #0 (empty assignment).
    * ``users > connections`` → assign the top N users; surplus surface
      only in ``channel_viewers``.

    Server-proxy topology (bd-mlcla B1 + bd-r5f0c.9 preservation): a
    connection flagged ``is_server_proxy`` IS the media server's own
    transcoding pull and can carry multiple of the channel's viewers on one
    Dispatcharr connection. **The direct (non-proxy) connections are
    reconciled FIRST** — each distinct direct connection consumes a distinct
    candidate user at most once (the same anti-collapse group walk used in
    the proxy-free topology). **The server-proxy connection then carries the
    REMAINING (unconsumed) users** as its rollup (2+ remaining → full list,
    1 → single user, 0 → User #0). This guarantees a browser-direct viewer
    sharing a channel with a proxy pull always gets its own distinct name
    whenever an unconsumed matching user exists (the TSN5 mixed case), while
    a proxy serving N app-viewers with no direct connection still carries the
    full set (bd-r5f0c.9). This is what lets the same model serve both
    server-mediated and browser-direct playback without collapsing,
    broadcasting, or dropping a viewer to User #0.

    When two or more connections are flagged ``is_server_proxy`` on the same
    channel (an exotic multi-proxy topology), they are processed in input
    order: the first consumes the remaining set, the rest get User #0 (one
    proxy already represents every upstream session, so a second would
    double-count).

    Option B (residual ambiguity): within a single IP-priority group of
    NON-proxy connections, if the group has 2+ connections AND is offered
    2+ users, the group is genuinely unorderable, so every connection in it
    gets the SAME ``"N viewers: ..."`` rollup of the users that group
    consumed — no single (possibly-wrong) name is pinned. A group offered
    exactly one user, or a group of one connection, resolves to a single
    name.

    Args:
        connections: The channel's connections. URL-identity connections
            are filtered out internally via :func:`eligible_connections`.
        users: The distinct candidate users the resolvers matched. De-duped
            and ranked internally via :func:`distinct_users`.
        trusted_networks: Pre-built trusted-network list (see
            :func:`build_trusted_networks`). ``None`` → empty → every
            connection ranks UNKNOWN and ordering falls back to
            ``connected_at`` (still correct; IP only breaks ties).
        channel_label: Optional human-readable channel identifier (e.g.
            ``"494 | TSN 5"`` or a channel UUID + source) stamped into the
            ``[RECONCILE]`` result log so the per-channel assignment outcome
            is diagnosable in one log read. Logging-only; never affects the
            result. ``None`` → the label renders as ``"?"``.
