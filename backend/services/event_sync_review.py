"""
Event sync review-queue identity layer — content fingerprints + operator
decisions (bead enhancedchannelmanager-ti939.3.2, epic ti939 "Event Sync").

Ambiguous-band matches (including the contested rail) route into an
operator review queue instead of being silently skipped. This module owns
the PURE half of that feature: how a queue item is IDENTIFIED and how an
operator's prior decisions feed back into resolution. Persistence lives in
``services.event_sync_review_store``; the DB model is
``models.EventSyncReview``.

**Fingerprint keying (HARD security constraint, epic ti939.3).** Every
pending question and every accepted/rejected outcome keys on the content
fingerprint

    (rule_id, provider_id, normalized_stream_name_hash, normalized_event_key)

and NEVER on channel or stream IDs. Rationale: Dispatcharr stream IDs churn
on every provider refresh and channel IDs are stable only while an event's
channel lives — a queue keyed on IDs would refill with duplicates of
already-answered questions after every refresh (the exact failure the epic
forbids). The four components:

* ``rule_id`` — the event_sync rule the question arose under (scoping is
  the caller's job; this module never sees rule ids).
* ``provider_id`` — the secondary stream's M3U account id. Account rows are
  ECM/Dispatcharr configuration, stable across refreshes.
  :data:`PROVIDER_ID_UNKNOWN` (0) is the documented sentinel when a stream
  carries no resolvable account id — such decisions still persist, but only
  re-apply to streams that are equally account-less.
* ``normalized_stream_name_hash`` — SHA-256 hex of the LOCALS-cleaned raw
  stream name (:func:`normalize_stream_name`). The same shared cleaner the
  unified scoring core uses, so cosmetic churn (case, punctuation, spacing,
  quality tags) does not mint a new question, while any change the MATCHER
  would see differently also re-opens the question — by construction the
  fingerprint can never be more forgiving than the scorer.
* ``normalized_event_key`` — the MASTER side's parsed event identity
  (:func:`master_event_key`): LOCALS-cleaned parsed title + the parsed
  start time normalized to UTC. Master channels are identified by parsed
  identity only (the epic's stateless-recompute contract); the key survives
  master-channel recreation and name dressing, and two sessions of the same
  fixture (main card vs. prelims) stay distinct via title and/or start.
  EXCEPTION (bead t6bin): when the parse SYNTHESIZED the date from "now"
  (the assume_current_date dateless variants), the key carries the literal
  ``dateless`` marker plus the LOCAL clock time instead of the fabricated
  date — a recurring dateless slot mints the SAME key every day, so
  accepts/rejects carry forward across midnight instead of re-asking.

**Decisions are an input to the ONE resolver, not a second scorer.**
:class:`ReviewDecisions` is consumed by
``services.event_sync_resolver.resolve_event_sync`` (the single decision
path shared by preview and attach — dry-run parity by construction):

* an ACCEPTED pairing auto-attaches when the matcher still surfaces that
  master as an attach- or ambiguous-band candidate. Accepts never override
  the matcher's hard rejects (team-token conflict, time window, below the
  ambiguous floor) — precision over recall, the 1,341-incident benchmark;
* a REJECTED pairing is suppressed entirely: the candidate is removed
  before classification, so it can neither attach (threshold OR decision)
  nor re-enqueue. An explicit operator "no" outranks score drift.

**Pure module.** No DB, no Dispatcharr client, no engine imports — same
isolation contract as ``services.event_sync_matcher``.
