"""
Event sync resolver — the ONE resolution layer shared by the Phase 1A
preview endpoint and the Phase 1B attach path
(bead enhancedchannelmanager-ti939.1.4, epic ti939 "Event Sync").

:func:`resolve_event_sync` takes a **validated** event_sync_config plus the
already-fetched master channel names and secondary streams, routes every
stream through ``services.event_sync_matcher.match_streams`` (per-group
pattern overrides applied), and classifies each stream into exactly one
disposition:

* ``would_attach`` — best candidate is in the matcher's ATTACH band; Phase
  1B attaches the stream to that master (preview only reports it).
* ``ambiguous`` — best candidate is in the AMBIGUOUS band, OR the attach
  decision is CONTESTED (more than one attach-band candidate / runner-up
  within ``CONTESTED_SCORE_EPSILON`` of the winner — the PR #613 rail):
  surfaced for operator review, never auto-attached.

**Review-queue decisions (bead ti939.3.2)** are an optional INPUT to this
resolver — never a second scorer. ``decisions`` carries prior operator
accepts/rejects keyed on content fingerprints
(``services.event_sync_review``):

* a REJECTED pairing's master is removed from the stream's candidate set
  BEFORE classification — it can neither attach (threshold or decision)
  nor re-surface as an ambiguous question;
* an ACCEPTED pairing upgrades an ``ambiguous`` disposition to
  ``would_attach`` (``attach_source="review_queue"``) when that master is
  still an attach- or ambiguous-band candidate. Accepts never override the
  matcher's hard rejects (team conflict, time window, below the ambiguous
  floor).

**Operator exclusions (bead ti939.3.5)** are a second optional INPUT:
``exclusions`` carries the rule's "never attach this pairing" fingerprints
(``models.EventSyncExclusion``, loaded by
``services.event_sync_exclusion_store``). An EXCLUDED pairing's master is
removed from the stream's candidate set BEFORE classification — before the
attach band is honored and before the accept-upgrade step, so an exclusion
OUTRANKS a prior review-queue accept for the same fingerprint (the two can
never both apply). A stream whose surviving candidates classify as
``unmatched`` while at least one pairing was exclusion-suppressed reports
the distinct ``excluded_by_operator`` disposition — visibly an operator
"never", not an inexplicable unmatch.

Because preview and attach both call THIS function with the same decisions
and exclusions objects, their application inherits the dry-run-parity
guarantee.
* ``unmatched`` — parses fine but no candidate survives (master-as-ceiling
  hedge: this list is the evidence base for any Phase 3 promotion feature).
* ``parse_failed`` — no complete parsed identity (title or start time
  missing). A silently broken pattern shows up here, loudly.

**Dry-run parity by construction.** The preview endpoint and the future
attach executor both call THIS function; there is no second scoring path
to drift. Scoring itself lives one layer down in the pure matcher.

**Pure module.** No Dispatcharr client, no DB, no engine imports — the
caller fetches; this module only resolves. Master channels are identified
by NAME only (PO decision: stateless recompute); the caller re-resolves
channel IDs against Dispatcharr on every run.

       threshold attaches, review-queue accept upgrades (exclusion
       OUTRANKS an accept for the same fingerprint — checked before the
       reject filter too, so a doubly-marked pairing counts as excluded)
       and re-enqueueing alike.
    1. REJECTED pairings are removed from the candidate set — an explicit
       operator "no" suppresses both threshold attaches and re-enqueueing
       for that exact pairing. Removal happens BEFORE classification, so
       e.g. a contest between A and a rejected B collapses to a clean
       threshold attach of A (the same answer the operator gave).
    2. The filtered candidates classify through the ONE band/contested

       ``demote_stale_dateless`` — the caller passes it True only when the

       knob on): a threshold would-attach is demoted to ``ambiguous``

       (counterfactual re-parse with the flag off yields no start time —
       dated stream names are never touched). Sits BEFORE step 3 so a prior
       operator ACCEPT of the pairing upgrades the demoted row right back
       to ``would_attach`` — the human answer outranks the heuristic.
    3. An ``ambiguous`` outcome is upgraded to ``would_attach``
       (``attach_source="review_queue"``) when an ACCEPTED pairing's master
       is still an attach- or ambiguous-band candidate — never a reject-band
       one (accepts do not override the matcher's hard rejects). Best-first
       order breaks the (pathological) multiple-accepts tie
       deterministically.
    4. A still-ambiguous stream exposes its enqueue-eligible pairings via
       ``review_candidates`` (attach/ambiguous band, best-first, capped).
    5. A stream whose FILTERED candidates classify as ``unmatched`` while
       at least one pairing was exclusion-suppressed reports the distinct

            default, not a hard minimum) — this module
            deliberately re-implements no policy.
        master_names: Names of the master group's channels (caller keeps
            the name → channel-ID mapping; this module never sees IDs).
        secondary_streams: Fetched secondary-group streams.
        now: tz-aware anchor for year inference. Defaults to the current
            time, computed ONCE here so every per-group ``match_streams``
            call shares the same anchor (a per-call "now" could infer
            different years across the calls of one resolution near the
            Dec/Jan boundary).
        decisions: Prior review-queue accepts/rejects for THIS rule
            (bead ti939.3.2), fingerprint-keyed — see the module docstring
            and :func:`_resolve_stream` for the application contract.
            ``None`` (or empty) preserves pre-queue behavior exactly.
        exclusions: Operator "never attach" fingerprints for THIS rule
            (bead ti939.3.5), the same ``(provider_id, stream_name_hash,
            event_key)`` shape as decision keys. Consulted BEFORE the
            attach band is honored and before accept upgrades — an
            exclusion outranks an accept for the same pairing. ``None``
            (or empty) filters nothing.
        attached_stream_ids: Stream ids already attached to a master
            channel (bead 6xxmp). Master-group streams (group_id ==
            master_group_id, present only when
            ``include_master_group_streams`` is on) whose id is in this set
            are dropped BEFORE scoring — the auto-synced provider's own
            streams are already on their channels, so re-offering them would
            desync preview ("would attach") from the run (an idempotent
            no-op). Scoped to the master group so every other secondary
            group's behavior is byte-identical. ``None`` (or empty) filters
