        UNIFIED REVERT. This is the single revert entry point and chooses its
        behaviour from whether the execution has a pre-run snapshot:

        * **Snapshot present** — requires ``confirm=True`` (the same
          acknowledgement the ``/restore-snapshot`` endpoint demands); without
          it, the call is refused with ``requires_confirm=True`` and
          ``has_snapshot=True`` so the router can surface the overwrite
          warning (HTTP 409). Once confirmed, the revert mechanism is chosen
          by journal coverage (bead sfysz):

          - When the journal PROVES every mutation the run made was an
            event_sync stream attach (category=event_sync merge_stream
            entries with batch_id=execution id fully covering the run's
            modified entities — see :meth:`_event_sync_journal_covers_run`),
            the SURGICAL :meth:`_journal_driven_unmerge` runs instead:
            it removes ONLY the stream ids the run added from each master's
            CURRENT stream list, preserving Dispatcharr's own master-stream
            churn between run and rollback. Dispatcharr never resets stream
            lists, so a stale id written by a full-replace would NOT
            self-heal — the full restore is strictly worse whenever the
            surgical revert suffices. Returns the legacy
            ``entities_removed``/``entities_restored`` shape plus
            ``surgical_unmerge: True``.
          - Otherwise (standard-rule runs, mixed runs, legacy runs,
            missing/partial journal), delegates to :meth:`restore_snapshot`
            for the FULL whole-run revert (re-adds streams the run removed,
            removes streams it added, restores drifted metadata) — an
            OPTIMISTIC OVERWRITE (ADR-010 §D5) that can clobber edits made
            AFTER the run, which is exactly why the confirm gate above is
            required either way.

        * **No snapshot** — the legacy delete-created-only path, BYTE-COMPATIBLE
          with the pre-uc51o.5 behaviour: deletes run-created entities, prefers
          the surgical journal-driven un-merge, else restores ``modified``
          entities. It does NOT require ``confirm`` (true backward compat for
          legacy / dry-run-then-claimed / capture-failure runs that have no
          snapshot to overwrite from).

        Args:
            execution_id: ID of the execution to rollback
            rolled_back_by: Who/what initiated the rollback
            confirm: Acknowledgement of the optimistic-overwrite warning. Only
                consulted when a snapshot is present; ignored on the legacy
                no-snapshot path.

        Returns:
            Dict with rollback results. The snapshot path returns the
            :meth:`restore_snapshot` shape (``removed_channels`` /
            ``restored_channels`` / ``failed_channels``); the legacy path
            returns the unchanged ``entities_removed`` / ``entities_restored``

        """Whole-run revert via the pre-run ChannelPipelineSnapshot (ADR-010 §D8).

        SAFETY-CRITICAL: this mutates live Dispatcharr channels. It performs an
        OPTIMISTIC OVERWRITE (ADR-010 §D5) — it unconditionally writes the
        snapshot's stream-set + key metadata back to each channel, clobbering
        ANY changes made (manual edits, Dispatcharr drift) AFTER the run but
        BEFORE this revert. The caller MUST surface the §D5 pre-revert warning;
        the endpoint requires an explicit ``confirm=true`` so a raw API call
        cannot skip the acknowledgement.

        Algorithm (ADR-010 §D8):
          1. Load the snapshot for ``execution_id`` (404-equivalent — returns
             ``{"success": False, "error": ...}`` with a ``no_snapshot`` flag so
             the router can map to 404 and tell the caller to use /rollback).
             Refuse a dry-run execution or one already in a terminal revert
             state, mirroring the rollback guards.
          2. Delete run-CREATED channels/groups first (via the existing
             ``_rollback_created_entity`` path) so channels that did not exist
             at snapshot time do not survive as orphans.
          3. For each snapshot channel, full-REPLACE its stream set
             (``update_channel(streams=[ids])`` — the §D1 IDs-only primitive)
             and restore key metadata (name, channel_group_id, epg_data_id,
             tvg_id) in one PATCH. Channels flagged ``event_sync_master`` at
             capture time get a STREAMS-ONLY payload instead (bead
             ti939.2.3): Dispatcharr owns their metadata, and the attach run
             only ever changed their stream list.
          4. Idempotent: re-running re-issues the same PATCHes / deletes →
             same end state. A second call after a clean first call finds the
             created channels already gone (delete 404 swallowed by
             ``_rollback_created_entity``) and re-writes the same stream-sets.
          5. Partial failures are COLLECTED and SURFACED, never silent and
             never fatal mid-run: a snapshot channel that 404s in Dispatcharr
             (deleted since the run) or a metadata/stream write that fails is
             recorded in ``failed_channels`` and the loop CONTINUES. The result
             reports ``restored_channels`` / ``removed_channels`` counts plus
             the per-item ``failed_channels`` list. ``success`` is True only
             when nothing failed; a run that failed on some items returns
             ``success=False`` (success-with-warnings) carrying the failures —
             NEVER a blanket success that hides them.

        Args:
            execution_id: ID of the execution whose pre-run state to restore.
            restored_by: Who/what initiated the restore (recorded on the row).

        Returns:
            On no-snapshot / guard failure: ``{"success": False, "error": ...,
            "no_snapshot": bool}``. On a restore attempt: ``{"success": bool,
            "execution_id", "rule_name", "removed_channels", "restored_channels",
            "failed_channels": [{"id", "name", "error"}]}``.

        When a rule selects normalization groups that are globally disabled (or
        no longer exist), every ``[NORMALIZE]`` decision applies nothing — the
        rule's prefixes/suffixes are never stripped and ``merge_streams
        target:auto`` matches almost nothing — yet the run otherwise looks
        clean. This surfaces the problem so the operator knows to enable the
        groups. It is ADDITIVE detection only: it does NOT change what gets
        normalized or merged.

        Returns a list of warning dicts, one per affected rule::

            {"type": "disabled_normalization_group",
             "rule_id": int, "rule_name": str,

                                  "missing": bool}]}

        The ``type`` discriminant (y3m6o.1 review) lets the frontend tell this
        warning apart from the ``non_reversible_profile_changes`` warning that
        shares the same persisted ``warnings`` JSON column — the two shapes are
        structurally different (this one carries ``disabled_groups``/``rule_name``,
        the other carries ``channel_ids``/``message``). Rows persisted before this
        discriminant existed have no ``type``; the frontend treats a missing
        ``type`` as this variant for backward compatibility.

        investigation). Reading the executor's cache directly mirrors the
        existing precedent elsewhere in this module (e.g.
        ``executor._channel_by_id`` in the EPG-retry and reconcile passes).

        Runs AFTER Pass 3 (rule-level ``sort_field`` renumber) so an
        explicit ``sort_group`` action — a more specific, per-action
        request — wins if a rule configures both mechanisms for the same
        channels.

        failures") into the execution log, a structured summary into
        ``results["event_sync"]``, and cap-overage / invalid-config warnings
        into ``results["event_sync_warnings"]`` (persisted onto the execution
        record by ``run_pipeline``).

        NEVER: creates/deletes channels, touches managed_channel_ids, or
        toggles Dispatcharr group settings — with ONE sanctioned, strictly
        opt-in exception (bead ti939.4.1): a rule whose config carries
        ``promote_unmatched: true`` CREATES ECM-managed channels for
        unmatched secondary-only events in its dedicated
        ``promote_target_group_id`` group, registers exactly those promoted
        channels in ``rule_channel_order`` (the managed set), and thereby
        opts into Pass 4 orphan reconciliation for them. Master-group
        channels stay Dispatcharr-owned and can never enter the managed set
        (the promotion lookup is scoped to the target group; this method
        re-asserts the invariant when registering).

        Pass 3.5 participation (bead io0tv): when the caller supplies
        ``rule_channel_order_streams``, each rule registers the master
        channels its attaches touched — INCLUDING idempotent already-attached
        no-ops — so a rule with ``stream_sort_field`` set (e.g.
        ``provider_order``) reorders its masters' streams on EVERY run, not
        only runs that performed a new attach (ordering heals after the
        operator changes M3U account priorities). ``stream_m3u_map`` is
        extended with provider ids from the secondary fetch (which still
        contains streams attached on PRIOR runs — they stay resident in
        their secondary groups) plus one bulk ``get_streams_by_ids`` read
        for the masters' own uncovered streams, so provider_order scoring
        sees every stream on the channel. Rules without a
        ``stream_sort_field`` register too but Pass 3.5 no-ops them —
        pre-feature rules keep append-only attach semantics unchanged.

        Unattended (watermark-triggered, ti939.3.1) calls add three gates on
        top of the manual path, each pinned by its own test:

        * **Per-rule trigger gate** — only rules whose config carries the
          explicit ``auto_run: true`` opt-in run; the rest are refused here
          even if a caller bypassed ``run_pipeline``'s routing.
        * **Circuit breaker (bead ixujz)** — a tripped run-on-refresh
          breaker (or the break-glass env var) refuses the WHOLE unattended
          phase before any fetch or write; manual runs are never gated (they
          are the recovery surface).
        * **Pre-flight (fail-closed)** — each opted-in rule's Dispatcharr
          group settings are checked (master auto-sync ON, secondaries OFF);
          on failure the rule is skipped with a persisted
          ``event_sync_preflight_failed`` warning that the watermark task
          turns into a notification. Manual runs never pre-flight here — the
          operator's preview carries the pre-flight surface.

        event_sync rules are excluded from Pass 1/2 action evaluation, so a
        configured ``assign_channel_profile`` action never fired on them before
        this. Root cause of #720: Dispatcharr auto-joins every new channel to
        ALL profiles, so honoring a profile selection is SUBTRACTIVE. This step
        reconciles exclusive membership on the channels this rule actually
        managed this run:

        * master channels that received a NEW attach (``merged_channel_ids`` —
          populated by the shared add_result chokepoint, live AND dry-run), and
        * promoted channels (the ONE event_sync channel-creation path — the
          exact "new channel joined to all profiles" case #720 describes).

        Idempotent no-op runs (nothing newly attached, no promotion) touch no
        channels, so steady-state runs perform NO profile writes — the action
        never churns Dispatcharr-owned masters it did not act on this run.

        Returns a step summary folded onto the rule's event_sync summary, or
        None when the rule carries no ``assign_channel_profile`` action (the
        common case — byte-identical to pre-feature behavior).

        preserves foreign streams across refreshes (verified in the ti939
        feasibility read), so restoring these stream-sets does not fight
        Dispatcharr's sync the way restoring its regenerable metadata would.
