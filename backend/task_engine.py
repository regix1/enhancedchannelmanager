# A per-target cross-instance-sync task is keyed ``dbas_sync_<target_id>``
# (``tasks/dbas_sync.py`` → ``sync_task_id_for``), and ``SyncTarget.id`` is a
# SQLite autoincrement primary key, so it is REUSED after a delete. Deleting a
# target prunes its ``scheduled_tasks`` and ``task_schedules`` rows
# (``remove_sync_target_task``) but not its ``task_executions`` rows — so the
# next target handed the same id opened carrying its predecessor's runs,
# including failures that were not its own, on the surface an operator uses to
# judge whether the target is healthy.
#
# THE INVARIANT these helpers enforce (the specification — delete-then-recreate
# is one example of it, not the definition): a ``task_executions`` row is
# attributed to a per-target sync task only when the live ``SyncTarget`` behind
# that id already existed when the run STARTED; an id with no live target
# behind it has no history at all.
#
# ``started_at`` and not ``completed_at``: a run in flight when its target is
# deleted is deliberately not interrupted, so it can finish after the
# replacement is created. It still is not the replacement's run.
#
# Enforced at the READ rather than by purging on delete. Purging would be a
# cleanup step, not a guarantee — ``remove_sync_target_task`` is best-effort by
# contract, runs after the delete has already committed, and would do nothing
# for installs already carrying orphaned rows. The rows are left in place (the
# ordinary 30-day ``purge_old_history`` retires them) so the audit trail of what
# a since-deleted target actually did is not destroyed.

    A kernel OOM-kill is a SIGKILL — no Python ``finally`` runs — so an

    ``status='running'`` forever. ``task_engine`` already reconciles stale

    boot finds nothing to do. The abandoned status is the DISTINCT value
    ``'abandoned'`` (NOT ``'failed'`` — an OOM crash is operationally different
    from a rule that errored and we want the UI/alerts to say so).
