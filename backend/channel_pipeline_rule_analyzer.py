"""
channel_pipeline_rule_analyzer — advisory analyzer for auto-creation rules.

Surfaces structural and regex-style configuration bugs in auto-creation
rules WITHOUT running them. Used by the /api/auto-creation/rules/analyze
endpoint (live-mode) and /from-bundle endpoint (debug-bundle upload).

Design rules:

* All findings are advisory — severity ``warning`` or ``info``. Saves
  never block on analyzer findings; that is what :mod:`regex_lint`'s
  strict path is for.
* The OR-grouping algorithm is duplicated from
  :func:`channel_pipeline_evaluator.evaluate_conditions` (lines 828–834).
  Duplication is intentional — the evaluator is performance-critical
  and we don't want a runtime import dependency just to read the
  algorithm. :func:`split_or_groups` and the test
  ``test_users_sports_rule_grouping`` lock the contract.
* External data (channel-group counts, execution history) is optional.
  When absent, the relevant findings simply aren't produced — never
  invent findings from missing data.
