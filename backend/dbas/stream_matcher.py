"""4-tier stream matcher for DBAS Phase-2 channel restore (PURE function).

This module implements the stream-matching fallback ladder that the channels
importer (bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-0i2vt.14``, integration umbrella) runs
when re-attaching an archived channel's embedded streams to the streams that
already exist on the *destination* Dispatcharr instance.

Bead: ``enhancedchannelmanager-al6e3`` (split 3/4 of ``0i2vt.14``).

WHY a pure function. The matcher is the hardest, most correctness-sensitive
piece of the channels importer, and the epic success signal is a ">99% match
rate" assertion over a production-shaped seed snapshot (bead
``enhancedchannelmanager-zqtjj``). To unit-test the matching *logic* exhaustively
without a live Dispatcharr instance, the matcher does ZERO I/O: the caller
fetches the destination instance's streams (``get_streams``) and passes them in
as ``candidates``. Same inputs → same output, deterministic, no global state, no
network, no DB. The live ">99%" signal is a SEPARATE integration test that
depends on the seeded test instance (``zqtjj``) — see the module-level NOTE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE 4-TIER LADDER (strongest signal first; first tier that hits wins)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Dispatcharr stream's *identity* is its upstream URL — a stream literally IS a
playable URL with a display name, ingested from an M3U provider
(``m3u_account``). This is the key difference from the ADR-008 *channel* dedup
matcher (``backend/services/dedup_matcher.py``), which is name-first because a
*channel* is a human-named container. A *stream* is URL-first. The ladder is
therefore ordered by how strongly each signal proves "this destination stream
is the same upstream stream the archive recorded":

* **Tier 1 — EXACT URL.** The archived stream's ``url`` equals a destination
  stream's ``url`` (case-sensitive; a URL path/query is case-significant).
  This is the canonical stream identity — the same provider serving the same
  endpoint. Strongest possible signal; never a false positive.

* **Tier 2 — EXACT NAME + SAME PROVIDER.** Same display name (after the shared
  conservative normalization) AND same ``m3u_account`` provider id. Covers the
  common case where a provider rotated its stream URLs (token refresh, CDN
  hostname change) but kept the channel line-up stable: the URL no longer
  matches (Tier 1 missed) but "same name from the same provider" is a high-
  confidence same-stream signal. Among the candidates that satisfy the tier, a
  candidate whose RAW ``name`` is byte-identical to the archived stream's RAW
  ``name`` is PREFERRED over one that only matches after case-folding — see
  "RAW-NAME PREFERENCE" below.

* **Tier 3 — EXACT NORMALIZED NAME (any provider).** Same normalized display
  name, regardless of provider. Covers a cross-provider migration (the operator
  restored onto an instance whose M3U accounts are different ids / different
  providers, but carry an equivalently-named stream). Looser than Tier 2 — the
  provider is not pinned — so it sits below it. Carries the same RAW-NAME
  PREFERENCE as Tier 2.

* **Tier 4 — FUZZY NORMALIZED NAME.** ``token_set_ratio`` of the normalized
  names ≥ :data:`STREAM_FUZZY_FLOOR`. Last resort before giving up: catches
  minor name drift (quality-tag reorder, punctuation, ``HD`` vs ``FHD``) that
  exact-normalized comparison misses. Reuses the exact RapidFuzz scorer and the
  ReDoS-hardened LOCALS normalizer the ADR-008 dedup matcher already ships, so
  the two matchers cannot drift on normalization.

* **MISS (Tier 0).** No tier hit. The matcher returns ``(MatchTier.MISS, None)``.
  The caller's custom-stream fallback (bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-ahygg``)
  takes over: it synthesizes a custom-stream M3U account for the orphan and
  logs a WARN so operators see when the heuristic fires. That synthesis is NOT
  this bead — this bead only *reports* the miss.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RAW-NAME PREFERENCE INSIDE THE EXACT-NAME TIERS (bead ``…-ixdaw``, drill run 4)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

:func:`_normalized_name` case-folds, so two destination streams whose names
differ ONLY in capitalisation are indistinguishable to Tiers 2 and 3. Drill run
4 (2026-08-05) measured the consequence on a real channel seeded with

    ``'TX | DALLAS | PBS KERA'`` (id 102) and ``'TX | Dallas | PBS KERA'`` (id 101)

on the same provider: BOTH archived slots satisfied Tier 2 against BOTH
candidates, the lowest-id tie-break handed both of them **101**, and id 102 — a
byte-identical name match for the first slot — sat unused. Downstream that costs
the channel a stream, or (unguarded) a duplicate id in the channel PATCH that
Dispatcharr rejects with ``unique_channel_stream``.

So, WITHIN each exact-name tier: among the candidates that already satisfy that
tier's predicate (for Tier 2 that includes the same-provider condition), if any
have ``candidate["name"] == stream["name"]`` EXACTLY, the selection is restricted
to those. The lowest-id tie-break then applies inside whichever set was selected.

This is strictly an improvement, never a behaviour change:

* no candidate is a raw-name match → the selected set is unchanged and the
  result is byte-identical to the pre-fix behaviour;
* exactly one is → it is unambiguously the right stream;
* several are → the existing lowest-id tie-break still decides, so the function
  stays deterministic and order-independent.

The tier NUMBER is unaffected: a raw-name hit inside Tier 2 is still Tier 2. The
ladder's tier integers are public contract and are asserted by the tests.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A REDACTED URL IS NOT AN IDENTITY (bead ``…-1td94``, live on 0.29.0 2026-08-20)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ladder's first principle — "a stream IS a playable URL" — has a corollary the
original ladder did not state, and a credential redactor then walked straight
into. Bead ``…-msqf7`` rewrites the credential PATH SEGMENTS of an Xtream Codes
stream URL rather than dropping the address, so what the archive carries is::

    http://provider:9191/live/***REDACTED***/***REDACTED***/53.ts

That string is not a weaker identity. It is the RECORD THAT AN IDENTITY WAS
REMOVED — and two records of an absence are byte-equal to each other. The
placeholder ``custom_stream_fallback`` synthesizes from the archived record
inherits the same string, so the placeholder became a perfect Tier-1 match for
the record that produced it, permanently outranking the real stream that arrives
later once the operator re-credentials the replica::

    archived RAW url       -> tier=1 match_id=118   (real stream)
    archived REDACTED url  -> tier=1 match_id=7     (the placeholder itself)

53 of the replica's 59 channels sat on match_id=7 and fetched HTTP 404. Closing
Tier 1 alone only moved the wrong answer one rung down: Tiers 2–4 admitted both
rows on an identical name and the lowest-id tie-break still chose the dead one,
because the placeholder was created first. So the rule is stated in two places
and both are needed:

* a SENTINEL-BEARING archived url does not participate in Tier 1 at all;
* inside EVERY tier, a candidate that can serve outranks one that cannot
  (:func:`_select_in_tier`) — deprioritized, never excluded, so a cycle with no
  live stream yet still re-finds its own placeholder instead of synthesizing a
  second one beside it.

Neither changes which tier fires, so spike ``xp6mp`` ruling 1b and bead
``…-efvyg``'s Tier-3 floor for sync are untouched. "Can serve" is
:func:`credential_sentinel.url_can_serve`, the one predicate every site in this
subsystem asks the question through; the sentinel string itself is ``…-msqf7``'s
to define and is never spelled out here.

SOURCING NOTE (read the report / bead comment for the full provenance trail):
the repo has **no pre-written 4-tier *stream* ladder** to copy — ``0i2vt.14``
refers to "sub-spike output" that was never committed as a doc or bead, and the
DBAS threat model / restore-contracts docs are silent on matching mechanics.
This ladder is therefore *derived*, not invented blindly: every primitive it
uses (the conservative + LOCALS normalizers, the ``token_set_ratio`` scorer,
the lowest-id tie-break, the ReDoS posture) is reused verbatim from the shipped,
reviewed ADR-008 dedup matcher. The tier *ordering* (URL > name+provider >
name > fuzzy > miss) is the defensible choice for stream identity and is flagged
as a confirm-me item for the code reviewer / PO in the bead report.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DETERMINISM CONTRACT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* PURE: no I/O, no DB, no network, no global mutable state.
* NO INPUT MUTATION: neither ``stream`` nor any ``candidates`` element is
  modified; the function only reads.
* DETERMINISTIC TIE-BREAK: within the winning tier, if several candidates tie,
  the candidate with the **lowest integer ``id``** wins. Mirrors the ADR-008
  dedup matcher's lowest-id rule (there the id is a UUID string; here a
  Dispatcharr stream id is an int, so it is a numeric min). Same inputs always
  produce the same ``(tier, id)`` regardless of candidate list order. In the
  exact-name tiers the tie-break runs over the raw-name-preferred subset when
  one exists (see RAW-NAME PREFERENCE) — still a pure, order-independent min.

Conventions (``docs/style_guide.md``): ``int, Enum`` with self-describing
values; ``snake_case``; Google-style docstrings; lazy ``%`` logging; no bare
``re.*`` on dynamically-built patterns (this module builds no regex — it reuses
the dedup matcher's pre-compiled, ``nosemgrep``-annotated patterns).

    ``raw_name`` byte-for-byte, the lowest id is taken from THAT subset only.
    Otherwise the lowest id across the whole admitted set is returned — exactly
    what :func:`_lowest_id_where` would have returned, so a run with no raw-name
    match is bit-identical to the pre-fix behaviour (bead ``…-ixdaw``).

    Args:
        candidates: The destination streams to scan (never mutated).
        predicate: A callable ``Mapping -> bool`` selecting matching candidates.
        raw_name: The archived stream's un-normalized ``name``. A non-``str``
            (or empty) value disables the preference and the helper degrades to
            :func:`_lowest_id_where`.

    Returns:
        The chosen ``id``, or ``None`` if no candidate satisfies ``predicate``.
