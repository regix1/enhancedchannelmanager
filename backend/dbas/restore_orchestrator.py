"""Phase-2 DBAS restore ORCHESTRATOR — pre-flight + apply + compensating rollback.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-0i2vt.18``. Dispatcharr has no database
transactions (ADR-012), so a restore that hits an upstream error mid-run could
leave a half-applied archive. This module is the safety layer that prevents that:

1. **Pre-flight** (``dbas.preflight``) validates the WHOLE plan before any write.
   A failing pre-flight refuses the restore with ZERO mutation — no importer is
   ever called.
2. **Ordered apply** runs the per-category importers in the hard Phase-2
   sequence through a clean registry of :class:`ImporterStep` callables. The
   importers record every created entity into the shared
   :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RollbackLedger` (they already do this); the
   orchestrator persists that ledger DURABLY after each step so a mid-restore
   ECM crash leaves a recoverable record.
3. **Compensating rollback** — if any step fails (raises, or reports a category
   failure in a FATAL category — see :data:`NON_FATAL_FAILURE_CATEGORIES`), the
   orchestrator issues compensating DELETEs in
   :meth:`RollbackLedger.compensation_order` (reverse creation = reverse
   dependency order). A delete that 404s counts as SUCCESS (already gone); a
   non-404 delete error means the rollback is INCOMPLETE.
4. **Outcome** (:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreOutcome`) is computed
   from what actually happened and is NEVER ``SUCCESS`` on mixed state.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HARD ORDERING (ADR-012 D-table) + the DEFERRED phase
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Importers run in strict dependency order::

    M3U accounts → EPG sources (+ bounded EPG-data download wait)
      → channel groups / channel profiles → user agents → stream profiles
      → Dispatcharr settings → ECM settings → users → channels → DVR rules
      → logos

USER AGENTS run BEFORE STREAM PROFILES (bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-lvfwd``).
A Dispatcharr stream profile carries a ``user_agent`` FK, so the USER_AGENT
IdRemapTable namespace must be populated before the stream-profile importer
rewrites it. The previous order (stream profiles first) POSTed the archived
SOURCE user-agent id at a destination that had not created the agent yet —
``400 {"user_agent":["Invalid pk \\"4\\" - object does not exist."]}`` — which
aborted the whole restore and rolled the instance back.

then the DEFERRED phase applies LAST: the M3U importer returns auto-sync
settings that MUST NOT fire during the run (they race the logo import on the
Dispatcharr side). The orchestrator collects each importer's deferred settings
and applies them only after every category is done, via
``dbas.importers.m3u_accounts.apply_deferred_auto_sync``. EPG data is the
opposite: Dispatcharr's channel↔EPG matching needs the data BEFORE channels are
created, so the apply registry's EPG step waits (bounded, non-fatal) for the
download instead of deferring it — see :func:`_epg_step_with_download_wait`.

AFTER the deferred phase, one final restore-completion step runs on a clean
apply: the PLACEHOLDER REBIND (:mod:`dbas.placeholder_rebind`, bead
``…-2o0cz``). Deferring the M3U refresh is what makes the restore safe, but it
also means every archived stream MISSED the matcher at channel-import time and
was synthesized as a URL-less placeholder — so the deferred refresh is the first
moment there is anything real to match against. Without this step a restore
reports ``success, 0 failures`` for an instance where not one channel can play.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FULL WIRING + dry-run/apply parity (bead kxcjf)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every per-category importer is WIRED into BOTH registries: the apply registry
(:func:`default_importer_steps`) and the dry-run registry
(:func:`dry_run_importer_steps`) cover the SAME category set, in the same
order, through the SAME shared step builders — so the counts the default-ON
dry-run preview promises are exactly what a confirmed apply delivers. The
orchestrator still supports a step with ``importer=None`` as a logged no-op
SEAM (never a silent skip) for callers that register partial step lists (e.g.
the sync engine's config-only registry), but neither default registry carries
one. PLUGINS are deliberately absent from both (ADR-012 D10).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABORT-ON-ANY-FAILED-KEY (PO decision 2026-08-03, enhancedchannelmanager-zt3kf)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The apply loop below aborts the WHOLE restore and rolls back on the FIRST
category that reports ANY ``failed`` count greater than zero (see ``if
cat.failed > 0`` a few lines below ``run_restore``) — including a category
whose only failures are benign-sounding ``FailureReason.DEPENDENCY_UNRESOLVED``
entries (e.g. a settings key present in the archive but absent on the
destination; see ``dbas.importers.settings_agents``). The ONE exception is
:data:`NON_FATAL_FAILURE_CATEGORIES` (see below). This is a DELIBERATE,
PO-confirmed policy, not an accident of the current importer wiring:

* There is NO per-key skip-with-warning path. A restore that could partially
  apply settings (skip only the unresolved keys, apply the rest) was
  considered and REJECTED — partial application of a config category is a
  worse failure mode than a clean full rollback: an operator staring at "12
  of 13 settings applied" cannot tell which one is missing without reading a
  report, and a half-applied settings category is the ONE thing in this
  orchestrator that CANNOT be compensated (see the settings-not-rolled-back
  note below) — so letting it partially land at all is strictly worse than
  refusing.
* Rationale: Dispatcharr has no transactions (ADR-012), so "abort on first
  failure, always" is the one rule simple enough to reason about under a
  crash mid-rollback, and it matches every OTHER load-bearing category's failure
  handling (channel groups, channels, …) — settings does not get a bespoke,
  softer rule just because its failure mode reads as benign.
* Operator-facing consequence: when the aborting category is SETTINGS and its
  failure reason is ``DEPENDENCY_UNRESOLVED``, :func:`run_restore` appends an
  explicit report note that a RETRY of the same restore against the SAME
  destination will fail identically (the artifact carries a settings key the
  destination does not have — no upstream flake, nothing to retry past). The
  remediation is to edit the category selection (exclude Settings) or restore
  against a destination whose Dispatcharr version has that key — never "try
  again."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE NON-FATAL CATEGORIES (beads enhancedchannelmanager-y65si + …-d0agi)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

``dispatcharr_users`` and ``logos`` are the members of
:data:`NON_FATAL_FAILURE_CATEGORIES`. A row upstream refuses in either category
is COUNTED as a failure in that category (visible in the report, listed in
``failure_details``, and it forbids a ``SUCCESS`` outcome) but does NOT abort the
run or trigger a compensating rollback. The restore continues and the outcome is
:attr:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreOutcome.COMPLETED_WITH_FAILURES`.

The admission test is the same for both, and it is narrow: NOTHING ELSE IN THE
RESTORE HOLDS A HARD FK INTO THE CATEGORY, so a row that does not come back
degrades only itself. Do not widen this set without demonstrating that.

* **users** (y65si): nothing else in the restore references a user, and the
  drill (bead ``…-a429n``) showed the alternative is catastrophic. One archived
  user Dispatcharr would not create cost the operator their M3U account, EPG
  source, channel groups and channel profile, PLUS an ECM settings mutation the
  rollback cannot compensate at all.
* **logos** (d0agi): a channel's ``logo_id`` is a SOFT reference. The logos
  importer already treats an unrestorable logo as a counted, reported miss
  (:attr:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreReport.logo_misses`, the D9 red banner,
  and the affected-channel drill-down), and
  :func:`dbas.channel_reattach.reattach_channel_logos` simply leaves the channel
  without artwork. Logos also run LAST in the hard ordering, so a logo failure
  can only ever destroy work that already succeeded. The drill (run
  ``2026-08-04-run2``) saw exactly that: ONE image that could not be written
  rolled back 44 successfully-restored entities. A channel with no artwork is a
  cosmetic defect; a rolled-back restore is a data-loss event.
* **upcoming_recordings** (…-ciabe): a recording is a pure LEAF. Nothing in the
  restore holds an FK into one — a channel does not know its recordings, and
  neither does a DVR rule (the rule's own generator finds them by querying, not
  by reference). It also runs after every category it depends on, so a refusal
  here can only ever destroy work that already succeeded. Weigh the two
  directions: one recording Dispatcharr will not schedule is one programme the
  operator records by hand, while rolling the run back over it costs them their
  channels, groups, profiles and settings. The upstream refusal this most
  plausibly comes from is a stale timestamp (``400 "End time must be in the
  future."``), which is a property of the ARCHIVE's age rather than of the
  destination — so a retry cannot fix it and a rollback would punish an operator
  for restoring an old backup.

Scope: this covers a REPORTED per-row failure. An importer that RAISES stays
fatal even for these categories. ``UsersCapabilityError`` (the fail-closed
User-schema guard) means "this destination cannot be reasoned about", not "one
bad row".

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
404-AS-SUCCESS + the credential-hygiene rule (the bead .8 lesson)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A compensating DELETE that returns 404 is treated as a successful compensation
(the entity is already gone — desired end state). Only a non-404 upstream error
counts as a failed compensation and drives ``FAILED_ROLLBACK_INCOMPLETE``.

We log/report only SAFE fields — entity type, destination id, label (a name,
never a credential), counts, status codes. We never log a server_url, username,
password, or an upstream SDK exception body verbatim.

Conventions (``docs/style_guide.md``): Pydantic v2 models; ``snake_case``;
Google-style docstrings; lazy ``%``-formatted logging; no secrets in any log or
report field.

      where every channel works.
    * NEVER a faithful absence (bead ``…-15g1j``). A channel whose SOURCE has no
      EPG link, no logo and no stream has lost nothing; the literal reading of
      the invariant turned all ten keystone round-trip scenarios red for
      replications that had lost nothing.

    THE PROPERTY (bead ``…-bj442``), of which a wrong password is one example:

        A realized cycle that could not read the destination it describes
        records an outcome no consumer can read as success — and records the
        SAME one everywhere, because this is the only place that decides it.

    Bead ``…-jqfxm`` established the FACT
    (:attr:`RestoreReport.destination_unreadable`) and acted on it in
    ``tasks.dbas_sync``, which corrected what the operator is TOLD.
    ``report.outcome`` was not part of that decision, so every surface that
    RECORDS the run — the task-history ``details.outcome`` row an API or MCP
    consumer reads, the ``sync_outbound`` journal row, and the persisted
    ``sync_targets.last_outcome`` / ``last_full_sync_at`` columns — kept reading
    ``success`` for a cycle that never read the destination it claims to
    describe. Measured at ``02c2a312``: a confirmed apply whose readback gate
    passed and whose M3U category read then returned 503 recorded
    ``outcome=success``, ``last_outcome="success"`` and a fresh
    ``last_full_sync_at``, with every category ``failed`` at 0 — because every
    importer degrades a failed destination read to ``existing = []``.

    A SIBLING OF THE DELIVERY-SHORTFALL SET, NEVER A MEMBER OF IT.
    :attr:`RestoreReport.DELIVERY_SHORTFALL_FIELDS` means "the source had this
    and the replica does not": a LOSS from a cycle that RAN, whose applied state
    is real, kept and reasonable-about, and every member of it resolves to
    ``COMPLETED_WITH_FAILURES`` — which
    :attr:`RestoreOutcome.is_degraded_not_failed` maps to a ``warning`` carrying
    a per-task opt-out. An unread destination is not that. Nothing was lost; the
    cycle never read the thing it describes, so it knows neither what the
    destination carries nor what it applied. Bead ``…-jqfxm`` deliberately
    treats that as an ERROR, so making it a shortfall member would downgrade a
    hard failure into an opt-out-able warning — the inverse of the defect.

    WHY ``FAILED_ROLLBACK_INCOMPLETE`` and not one of the other three. It is the
    only value that means INDETERMINATE — "the caller cannot tell what it got" —
    which is exactly the state ``…-jqfxm`` describes. ``SUCCESS`` and
    ``COMPLETED_WITH_FAILURES`` both assert the run finished and left state the
    operator can reason about; ``PARTIAL_FAILED_ROLLED_BACK`` asserts the
    instance is back to its pre-restore state. All three are claims ABOUT the
    destination, and a run that could not read it cannot make one.
    ``tasks.dbas_sync_engine`` already resolves a no-rollback, no-residue
    source-side name conflict to this same value.

    THE ``…-cwmid`` PROPERTY IS PRESERVED: this returns an OUTCOME and nothing
    else. Severity is still read off the outcome alone
    (:attr:`RestoreOutcome.is_degraded_not_failed`), so no condition is ever
    consulted for one and no condition can reorder the severities.

    A DRY RUN gets ``None``: a preview has no realized outcome to record (the
    ``…-kxuj2`` contract) and nothing was applied to be indeterminate. The
    marker still fails the preview at the task layer, which is ``…-jqfxm``'s
    half and is unchanged.

    Args:
        report: The restore report, carrying the ``…-jqfxm`` marker or not.

      Any whiff of failure forbids SUCCESS.
    * ``COMPLETED_WITH_FAILURES`` — the apply never decided to abort, so nothing
      was rolled back and the applied state stands, but the result is not clean.

      play behind a reported ``success … created 32, failed 0``, and the
      cross-instance sync measured 53 of 59 replica channels landing with no
      guide link and every logo binding lost behind ``success … failed 0``.
      Nothing is rolled back — the applied state is real and worth keeping.

      The trigger is the SET, never which member fired. Bead ``…-cwmid`` had to
      undo a narrower keying after a drill measured the severity ordering
      inverted; every member resolves to this one outcome, and severity is

    * ``FAILED_ROLLBACK_INCOMPLETE`` — the INDETERMINATE state, reported loudly.
      Either a fatal failure occurred and the rollback could not fully undo it
      (non-404 delete error, or a type with no compensator), or the run could
      not read the destination it describes and therefore knows neither what
      that destination carries nor what it applied (bead ``…-bj442``, keyed on

    """Run a full restore: pre-flight → ordered apply → rollback-on-failure.

    The single orchestration chokepoint. Behaviour:

    0. **Default-ON dry-run guardrail (bead ``…-0i2vt.16``).** A restore is a
       counts-only DRY-RUN unless the caller passes ``confirm_apply=True``. Apply
       is opt-IN, never opt-out: without an explicit confirm the run is FORCED to
       ``report.is_dry_run = True`` and makes ZERO mutations no matter what the
       caller put on the report. This is an architectural property of the entry
       point — not a UI toggle a client could bypass. The destructive apply path
       requires both ``confirm_apply=True`` AND a non-dry-run report; a caller that
       sets ``is_dry_run`` on the report keeps the dry-run even with a confirm.
    1. **Pre-flight** (``run_preflight``). On a FAIL the restore is refused with
       ZERO mutation — no importer step is called — and the report is returned
       with ``outcome=FAILED_ROLLBACK_INCOMPLETE`` only if mutation had occurred;
       a pure pre-flight refusal records the problems as notes and leaves
       ``outcome`` ``None`` (nothing happened to have an outcome). The caller
       inspects ``report.notes`` / the returned report for the refusal.
    2. **Ordered apply**: run ``steps`` in registration order (the hard Phase-2
       sequence). After each step the ledger is persisted durably. A step that
       raises, or whose category reports a failure, triggers rollback of
       EVERYTHING created so far and stops the apply.
    3. **Deferred phase** (only when no failure): apply the collected deferred
       settings LAST via ``deferred_apply_fn``.
    4. **Outcome**: computed via ``compute_outcome`` — never SUCCESS on mixed
       state, which since bead ``…-daziw`` includes an apply that finished with
       a channel left holding no URL-bearing stream (``COMPLETED_WITH_FAILURES``:
       ran to completion, nothing rolled back, but something the operator had is
       not working). On clean success the durable ledger file is removed.

    Args:
        plan: The restore plan (categories + manifest + any pre-known remap).
        client: The Dispatcharr API client.
        steps: The ordered importer registry. A step with ``importer=None`` is a
            logged no-op SEAM.
        report: The shared restore report (populated by the importers).
        ledger: The shared rollback ledger (populated by the importers).
        remap: The shared IdRemapTable (threaded through importers).
        confirm_apply: The explicit opt-in to MUTATE. ``False`` (default) forces a
            dry-run — no importer mutates, no rollback, no deferred phase. ``True``
            lets the apply proceed ONLY when ``report.is_dry_run`` is also False.
        deferred_apply_fn: The deferred-apply coroutine (defaults to the M3U
            ``apply_deferred_auto_sync``); applied LAST on a clean run.
        ledger_dir: Override the durable ledger directory (tests).
        max_entities_per_category: Pre-flight count bound override (tests).
        channel_reattach_mode: What the post-create reattach passes do to
            channels this restore did NOT create (bead …-dfkbn, PR review W1).
            ``PRESERVE`` (default) leaves a matched-existing channel's EPG link
            and logo exactly as the operator has them; ``OVERWRITE`` applies the
            archive's. On an empty destination every channel is created and the
            two are indistinguishable.
        allow_fuzzy_stream_match: The stream-matching policy for the WHOLE run —
            whether the matcher's Tier-4 fuzzy rung is admitted. It must be the
            same value the ``steps`` registry was built with, because the
            post-create rebind (step 3c) is a second matcher pass over the same
            archived streams; a run whose importers are floored at Tier-3 and
            whose rebind is not does not have a stream-matching policy at all
            (bead ``…-efvyg``). Both production callers state it rather than
            inherit it:

            * the ARCHIVE RESTORE (``tasks.dbas_restore``) passes ``True`` — the
              value :func:`dbas.importers.channels.import_channels` already uses
              on that path, and the one the ``…-2o0cz`` rebind was designed
              around: on a fresh restore the destination has no provider streams
              at channel-import time, so the rebind is where essentially ALL of
              a restore's matching actually happens. Flooring it would strand
              restored channels on placeholders — the P0 this pass exists to fix.
            * the CROSS-INSTANCE SYNC (``tasks.dbas_sync_engine``) passes the
              per-``SyncTarget`` ``fuzzy_stream_matching`` flag (default OFF),
              the enforcement point for spike ``xp6mp`` ruling 1b.

            ``True`` is the default only so the many call sites that never reach
            the rebind (dry-runs, registries with no channels step) need not
            restate a policy they do not exercise; the value is REQUIRED at
            :func:`dbas.placeholder_rebind.rebind_placeholder_streams`, the
            boundary that consumes it, where omission was what made the defect
            silent.

    Bead ``kxcjf`` closed the silent-skip defect: this registry previously wired
    only M3U accounts / users / channels and left EPG sources, channel
    groups/profiles/stream profiles, user agents, DVR rules, settings, and logos
    as ``importer=None`` seams — a confirmed apply silently no-opped those
    categories while the default-ON dry-run preview promised their counts. Both
    registries now cover the SAME category set (the dry-run/apply parity bar);
    ``dry_run_importer_steps`` mirrors this order exactly.

    Ordering (dependency-driven, ADR-012 D-table):

      * user agents FIRST (bead ``…-9h6cv``) — a leaf that resolves nothing,
        and the namespace BOTH the M3U account's and the stream profile's
        ``user_agent`` FK resolve through. Anything ahead of it meets an empty
        namespace.
      * M3U accounts next (defers auto-sync to the final phase) — everything
        downstream remaps ``m3u_account`` FKs through it.
      * EPG sources next, WITH the bounded EPG-data download wait
        (:func:`_epg_step_with_download_wait`) so Dispatcharr has EPG rows
        before channels are created.
      * channel groups / channel profiles / stream profiles before channels —
        they populate the IdRemapTable namespaces the channels importer resolves.
        The stream profiles' ``user_agent`` FK is why the agents lead the list
        (bead ``…-lvfwd``): the reverse order POSTed a raw source id and aborted
        the whole restore on a fresh destination. Bead ``…-9h6cv`` found the M3U
        account carries the same FK, so the agents moved ahead of it too.
      * settings (core settings / comskip) before channels (config in place
        before the big entity category), then ECM's OWN settings.json — a
        SEPARATE category (bead …-dfkbn item 4), because the drill's report said
        ``settings updated=7`` while ECM's ``user_timezone`` and
        ``stats_poll_interval`` silently reverted: that count was Dispatcharr's
        namespace, and ECM's own blob had no importer at all.
      * users before channels (the l1p4p slot; unchanged) — and AFTER channel
        profiles, which is now load-bearing rather than incidental: a user's
        ``channel_profiles`` list is a LIST-VALUED FK remapped through the
        CHANNEL_PROFILE namespace (bead ``…-if05f``). Both registries already
        ordered profiles ahead of users; moving USER above CHANNEL_PROFILE would
        meet an empty namespace and skip every profile-scoped user.
      * channels, then DVR rules (a DVR rule's ``channel`` FK remaps through the
        just-populated ``EntityType.CHANNEL`` namespace), then logos LAST
        (attach to the created channels; slow streaming uploads at the tail).

    Two categories also run a POST-CREATE REATTACH pass inside their own step
    (bead ``…-dfkbn``), because the reference they restore is a SOURCE id that
    the create payload has to drop: channels reattach their EPG link (by the
    archived ``tvg_id``) and re-assert their archived channel-profile selection;
    logos reattach each channel's ``logo_id``. Both run only on an apply, after
    their importer, when the remap namespaces they resolve through are populated.
    See :mod:`dbas.channel_reattach`.

    PLUGINS stay excluded per ADR-012 D10 (RCE-vs-config unresolved) — there is
    deliberately no plugins row in either registry.

    dry-run uses the plain importer (no download trigger, no wait — a plan must

    Bead ``…-0i2vt.16``. The default-ON entry: the restore UX ALWAYS calls this
    first so the operator sees "would create N / update M / skip K" before any
    apply. It runs every importer with dry-run on (``dry_run_importer_steps``),
    aggregating each category's ``would_create`` / ``would_update`` / ``would_skip``
    into one :class:`RestoreReport` whose ``is_dry_run`` is True and whose
    ``outcome`` is ``None`` (a plan has no realized outcome).

    Because it delegates to :func:`run_restore` with ``confirm_apply=False`` and a
    dry-run report, the engine's guardrail guarantees ZERO mutation: no create,
    update, delete, upload, bulk-delete, rollback, or deferred auto-sync fires.

    Args:
        plan: The restore plan (categories + manifest + any pre-known remap).
        client: The Dispatcharr API client (only its READ methods are exercised).
        steps: Override the importer registry (tests / a future endpoint that
            shares the apply registry for the parity check). Defaults to
            :func:`dry_run_importer_steps`.
        ledger_dir: Override the durable ledger directory (tests). The dry-run
            never writes ledger entries, but pre-flight refusal paths share the
            signature.
        max_entities_per_category: Pre-flight count bound override (tests).
        channel_reattach_mode: The mode the operator has selected. The preview
            MUST be produced under the same mode the apply will run under, or it
            mispredicts exactly the number the mode exists to control.

    Returns:
        A :class:`RestoreReport` with ``is_dry_run=True`` carrying the per-category
        ``would_*`` counts, the ``logo_misses`` aggregate, and the
        ``epg_link_reattach`` / ``logo_reattach`` population splits.
