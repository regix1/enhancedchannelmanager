"""Post-create channel reattachment — EPG links, logos, profile membership.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-dfkbn`` items 1-3. Three kinds of channel state

======================  ========================  ===============================

Dropping the two FK fields at create time is CORRECT — a stale source id would
either 400 or, worse, silently bind an unrelated destination row. What was
missing is the second half: a post-create pass that re-derives each reference on
the DESTINATION and PATCHes it back. That is this module.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW EACH REFERENCE IS RE-DERIVED
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Logos** — through the ``LOGO`` :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.IdRemapTable`
  namespace the logos importer populates (matched OR uploaded OR re-created by
  URL). A channel whose archived ``logo_id`` does not resolve is a COUNTED miss:
  it feeds :attr:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreReport.logo_misses` with the
  affected channels NAMED. This is the counter the drill needed — it read ``0``
  while 12 channels lost a logo they had.

* **EPG links** — by the archived ``tvg_id``, NOT by ``epg_data_id``. A
  Dispatcharr EPG row's pk is instance-local and is re-minted when the source
  re-downloads its guide, so it cannot round-trip; ``tvg_id`` is the stable
  cross-instance identity (it is the id the XMLTV feed itself carries, and
  Dispatcharr's own channel↔EPG matching keys on it). Unresolvable => counted in
  ``epg_links_unrestored`` and named.

  WHICH ``tvg_id`` (drill run 2026-08-04-run2, bead ``…-dfkbn``). A channel row
  carries its OWN ``tvg_id`` field, and that field is NOT the link: ECM's own
  channel PATCH sets ``epg_data_id`` and leaves ``tvg_id`` null, which the drill
  measured directly (``epg_data_id=1``, ``tvg_id=None`` after the PATCH). Every
  one of the drill's 7 linked channels therefore reached this pass with an empty
  ``tvg_id`` and every link was dropped. The link's natural key lives on the EPG
  ROW the channel points at, so the backup producer now resolves it there and
  stamps it on the archived channel as :data:`ARCHIVE_EPG_TVG_ID_KEY`
  (``routers/backup.py``, ``_resolve_epg_link_natural_keys``). This pass PREFERS
  that resolved value and FALLS BACK to the channel's own ``tvg_id``. An OLD
  artifact carries no resolved key, so it behaves exactly as it did before.

  WHAT THE RELINK WRITES (drill run 2026-08-08-run17, bead ``…-qka89``). The
  PATCH carries the resolved ``epg_data_id`` AND the channel's own archived
  ``tvg_id``, because restoring only the link left the channel resolving to one
  guide row while advertising another — see :func:`_relink_payload`.
  ``tvc_guide_stationid`` is NOT part of this: it is the Gracenote station id,
  it has no half restored by this pass, and a channel this restore CREATES gets
  it verbatim from the archive through the channel-create payload. It therefore
  has no asymmetry to fix here.

* **Profile membership** — from the archived CHANNEL PROFILE rows, whose
  ``channels`` field is Dispatcharr's list of ENABLED channel ids
  (``ChannelProfileSerializer.get_channels`` filters ``enabled=True``). This is
  the only place the selection exists: Dispatcharr's CHANNEL serializer carries
  no membership at all, which is why the channels importer's original
  ``profile_memberships``-on-the-channel reattach never had anything to read.
  Every restored channel is re-asserted ENABLED or DISABLED against that list,
  and each flip away from the destination's enable-everything default is counted
  as DRIFT.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT A DRY RUN CAN HONESTLY PREDICT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both passes also run on a DRY RUN, because the number that decides whether an
operator wants :attr:`~dbas.restore_contracts.ChannelReattachMode.OVERWRITE` at
all is "how many channels I ALREADY have would this replace", and that number is
useless after the fact. Neither pass mutates anything on a dry run.

Neither pass records a MISS on a dry run either. A miss is a claim that
something the operator had is GONE, and the dgnms defect was exactly a preview
making that claim about a restore that was going to work. On a dry run these
passes report the population SPLIT and nothing else.

What each pass may resolve at preview time is NOT symmetric, and the asymmetry
is about one question: does the destination state this pass matches against
already exist, or does THIS RESTORE create it?

* **EPG links — resolve the CHANNEL remap, never the GUIDE.** The two are
  different kinds of state and the rule above sorts them cleanly.

  The GUIDE rows this pass matches ``tvg_id`` against are rows the restore ITSELF
  puts there: the EPG-source step runs before channels and waits for Dispatcharr
  to download the guide (``_epg_step_with_download_wait``), and on a dry run that
  wrapper is a pass-through. Reading the destination's guide during a preview
  therefore reads the PRE-restore guide, which on a disaster-recovery target is
  EMPTY. An earlier cut of this module did resolve it, and a 200-channel DR
  preview reported "200 channels restored without an EPG link", named all 200,
  and then the apply restored every one.

  The CHANNEL REMAP is the opposite: this same run's channels importer populates
  it, on a dry run as much as on an apply, so it is state that already exists by
  the time this pass runs. A later cut over-corrected and stopped reading it too,
  and a channel the importer SKIPPED — ``DEPENDENCY_UNRESOLVED``, or the
  ambiguous null-``channel_number`` CONFLICT — has no entry in it, so it was
  classified as a pre-existing channel whose live guide link would be REPLACED.
  An operator previewing a merge with "replace" selected and channel groups
  deselected got a red alert naming their channels for a restore that touches
  none of them. A channel that does not resolve is in NEITHER half of the split
  and is not a miss: it is simply not visible from a preview.

* **Logos — resolve what already exists, plus what this run has decided to
  create.** The ``LOGO`` remap this pass reads is populated during the SAME run
  by the logos importer, which registers a destination id for every archived
  logo it MATCHES against the destination (``importers/logos.py``) on a dry run
  as much as on an apply. For a merge into a live install that matched
  population IS the population, so the preview was already faithful there.

  It was NOT faithful on a FRESH target (bead ``…-dgnms``, drill run 4). Nothing
  matches on an empty destination, so every logo is a would-CREATE, and a
  would-create has no destination id — the importer deliberately registers none,
  because the id an apply mints is not knowable and a fabricated one would
  corrupt every FK resolved through it. The whole population fell out of the
  split and the preview reported ``logo_reattach.created_channels: 0`` for an
  apply that reattached 11 minutes later.

  So the importer now also reports the SOURCE ids it would create
  (``LogoImportResult.would_create_source_ids``) and this pass counts those
  channels too. No id is invented: "this logo will exist" is a decision the same
  run's importer has already taken, which is the same class of already-existing
  state as the CHANNEL remap — and squarely the opposite of the destination
  GUIDE, which no part of the preview has decided anything about. A logo the
  importer REJECTS is not in the set, so it stays out of the split.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEST-EFFORT, NEVER FATAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These passes run after their category's entities already exist. An upstream
error is logged and surfaced (as a report note or a counted miss); it never
raises, never fails the category, and never triggers a rollback of state the
operator would rather keep. Losing a logo must not cost the operator their
channels — the same reasoning that made ``dispatcharr_users`` the one non-fatal
category (bead ``…-y65si``).

Conventions (``docs/style_guide.md`` / ``backend/CLAUDE.md``): ``snake_case``;
Google-style docstrings; lazy ``%`` logging with a ``[DBAS-REATTACH]`` prefix;
only operator-facing names in logs and report fields — never a URL or a secret.

    rejected) is recorded as a logo MISS naming the affected channel, so the
    aggregate the operator reads is the number of channels left without the logo
    they had rather than a flat ``0``.

    MODE (PR review W1). In :attr:`ChannelReattachMode.PRESERVE` (the default) a

    records NO miss. A channel is counted into the split only when BOTH its
    destination id and its logo resolve, which is the same condition the apply

    operator two channels would be replaced when the apply replaced none.

    A logo the restore will CREATE counts too, via
    ``would_create_logo_source_ids`` (bead ``…-dgnms``, drill run 4). It has no
    destination id yet — the logos importer registers none for a would-create,

    the whole answer: nothing matches, so every logo is a would-create, and the
    preview reported ``created_channels: 0`` for an apply that reattached 11.

    keyed on the latter. Restoring only the link leaves the channel internally
    inconsistent — drill run 2026-08-08-run17 (bead ``…-qka89``) measured a
    ``replace`` restore putting ``epg_data_id=3425`` back while the operator's
    ``tvg_id='KERA-DT2(HD06)(KERADT2).us'`` survived, so the channel resolved to

    For every restored channel, the membership is PATCHed to the archived
    ``enabled`` state. Dispatcharr's single-membership endpoint
    (``PATCH /api/channels/profiles/<p>/channels/<c>/``) CREATES the row when it
    is absent (0.28.2 ``apps/channels/api_views.py``, re-read on 0.29.0 —
    ``UpdateChannelMembershipAPIView.patch`` still creates the missing row at
    ``enabled=False`` and then applies the payload), so this works whether the
    channel create already added it or not.

    A CHANNEL PROFILE IS A RESTRICTION, so the degraded direction is not
    symmetric (bead ``…-38c5a``; the same fail-closed reasoning bead ``…-if05f``
    established for a user's ``channel_profiles`` list). Every way this pass can
    fail to assert a membership leaves Dispatcharr's enable-everything create
    default standing, which is the MAXIMUM exposure — so each of them is either
    corrected toward fewer enabled channels or counted where an operator will
    see it:

    * **The archive does not say what the profile enabled** (no ``channels``
      key at all, as opposed to an empty list, which is a real "nothing is
      enabled" selection). There is no faithful answer, so this DISABLES the
      memberships THIS run created — undoing the enable-everything side effect
      of our own channel creates, never touching a membership an operator set
      on a pre-existing destination channel — and names the profile in
      ``report.notes``. It used to ``continue`` silently, which handed the
      destination an unrestricted copy of a restricting profile.
    * **A membership PATCH the destination refuses** (B rate-limits, so a 429
      here is an ordinary operational event). The channel is left enabled and
      there is nothing this pass can do about it, so it is recorded as a
      CHANNEL_PROFILE failure — ``failed`` + a :class:`FailureDetail` — the same
      structure ``dbas/importers/channels.py`` uses for the same event. That
      forbids a SUCCESS outcome. It does NOT trigger a rollback: this pass runs
      inside the CHANNEL step, whose own category is what the orchestrator
      checks, and rolling a whole cycle back over one throttled PATCH would cost
      more than it saved.

    Only channels THIS restore resolved are touched: a channel that already
    existed on the destination and is not in the archive keeps whatever
    membership the operator gave it.

    WHAT THE COUNTER MEANS: MEMBERSHIPS THAT DRIFTED, NOT ONES WE ASSERTED
    (bead ``…-ukjx5``). The pass PATCHes every membership every cycle — that is
    the fail-closed guarantee above and it is deliberately unchanged — but it
    used to COUNT every flip it asserted, without ever asking what the
    destination already had. On a one-shot restore that is harmless. On a
    SCHEDULED cross-instance sync it meant a fully converged replica reported
    ``profile_membership_drift: 4`` on every cycle, forever: a number that looks
    like a finding, never changes, and trains the operator to ignore the one
    surface that would tell them a profile had genuinely widened.

    So the destination's CURRENT enabled set is read first
    (:func:`_destination_enabled_by_profile`) and a membership is counted only
    when what the destination has DIFFERS from what the archive says. Bead
    ``…-15g1j``'s line, from the other direction: re-asserting a membership that
    was already correct is faithful work, not a shortfall.

    Two things this deliberately does NOT do. It does not narrow what the pass
    WRITES — bead ``…-kcfru``'s rule is that detection and write authority are
    separate concerns, and the assert-everything write is what makes the pass
    idempotent and fail-closed. And it does not decide what the operator is
    SHOWN or whether any of this downgrades an outcome; that is bead
    ``…-posm1``'s.

    DRY RUN (bead ``…-dgnms``, drill run 4). This pass used to be apply-only, so
    a preview reported ``profile_membership_drift: 0`` for an apply that then
    reported 6 — the counter that exists precisely to warn an operator their
    hide-these-channels profile is about to widen was silent in the one place it
    could still be acted on. It is now predicted, from state the preview already
    holds plus the same destination reading the apply takes, and PATCHes nothing.

    The prediction stays EXACT because both branches now run the identical
    expression: a membership is treated as currently enabled when the
    destination's profile enables it, when this run CREATED the channel
    (Dispatcharr adds every new channel to every profile enabled — so a preview
    can predict what the apply is about to walk into), or when the profile is not
    on the destination yet at all. Whatever changes that must still change both
    branches together.

    """Report — and under OVERWRITE, restore — each channel's archived group.

    Bead ``…-r1ei7``. A channel that already exists on the destination is matched
    ``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL`` and never overwritten (spike ``xp6mp``), so its
    ``channel_group_id`` is never written. On a POPULATED target that means the
    lineup keeps whatever grouping the destination had — and drill run 12
    measured exactly that, in BOTH relink modes, with the restore reporting
    ``outcome=success, failed 0`` and no counter, panel or note mentioning it.
    The counts reconcile perfectly, which is what makes it dangerous.

    WHY THIS RUNS AFTER CHANNELS, NOT INSIDE THE GROUPS IMPORTER. Groups are
    restored BEFORE channels (the hard Phase-2 ordering; ADR-012), and a group's
    membership is not on the group row at all — it is the ``channel_group_id`` on
    each CHANNEL. At group-import time the destination's future membership does
    not exist yet, so there is nothing to compare. The comparison is only
    possible once every channel has been created or matched, which is here.

    MODE. :attr:`ChannelReattachMode.PRESERVE` (the default) REPORTS every
    divergence and PATCHes nothing — the operator merging into a live install
    chose it so their own lineup is left alone, and the "never overwrite an
    existing channel" contract keeps holding. :attr:`ChannelReattachMode.OVERWRITE`
    additionally moves the channel into the archive's group, and STILL records
    what it moved: reconciling silently would trade one invisible outcome for
    another.

    WHAT IS NOT DRIFT. A channel THIS restore created carried the archive's
    (remapped) group in its create payload, so it is correct by construction —
    counting it would report a correction that never happened, and on a fresh
    disaster-recovery target that is every channel. A channel already sitting in
    the archive's group is not news either.

    DRY RUN. Predicts exactly what the apply reports, from the same two inputs
    (the archived ``channel_group_id`` and the destination row the channels
    importer matched), and PATCHes nothing. The number that tells an operator
    what ``replace`` is about to do to their lineup is useless after the fact —
    the ``dgnms`` discipline.

    BEST-EFFORT, NEVER FATAL. An upstream failure is logged (by exception TYPE
    only — an httpx error's ``str()`` embeds the request URL) and the row is
    reported as NOT moved. Nothing here raises or triggers a rollback.

        client: The Dispatcharr API client.

            archive — read for their NAMES, so a drift row can say which group
            the archive means rather than quoting an instance-local id.
        matched_existing_channels: ``source id -> the destination row as the
            channels importer found it``, its out-parameter. A channel absent
            from it was not matched against a pre-existing row, so this pass has
