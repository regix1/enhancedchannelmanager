"""Custom-stream fallback synthesis for orphaned archived streams.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-ahygg`` (split 4/4 of the ``0i2vt.14`` channels
importer epic).

WHAT THIS IS. The 4-tier stream matcher (bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-al6e3``,
:func:`dbas.stream_matcher.match_stream`) tries to re-attach an archived
channel's embedded streams to streams that already exist on the *destination*
Dispatcharr instance. When every tier misses (``MatchTier.MISS``), the archived
stream is **orphaned** — the destination has no equivalent stream to point at.
Rather than silently drop the orphan (losing the operator's stream) or attach it
to a wrong stream, this module synthesizes a home for it:

1. **Ensure ONE synthesized "custom-stream" M3U account exists** on the
   destination. Find-or-create by a well-known name
   (:data:`CUSTOM_STREAM_ACCOUNT_NAME`): if an account with that name already
   exists (a prior restore run, or an earlier batch in this same run), reuse its
   id; otherwise create it once. Idempotent — a second batch within the same run
   reuses the just-created account (a one-call in-memory cache on the
   :class:`_FallbackState` the caller threads through), and a re-run reuses the
   account it finds on the destination.

2. **Create each orphan under that synthesized account** via
   ``client.create_stream`` (bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-nav0c``) and
   **attribute** it — the created stream's ``m3u_account`` field is set to the
   synthesized account's id so the orphan visibly belongs to the custom-stream
   provider. Each created stream id is recorded in the
   :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.IdRemapTable` under
   :data:`~dbas.restore_contracts.EntityType.STREAM` (source-export id ->
   destination id) and in the
   :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RollbackLedger` so a later restore failure
   compensates by deleting them in reverse order (the ``kxuj2`` contract).

3. **WARN on the fallback path EVERY time it fires** (``[DBAS_RESTORE]`` prefix,
   lazy ``%`` formatting) including the orphan count. This is a
   correctness/observability requirement, not optional: an operator MUST see
   that some streams could not be matched and were synthesized, so they can
   decide whether the destination's provider line-up is what they expected.

SCOPE — TIGHT. This module does NOT run the matcher (that is ``al6e3``) and does
NOT build the channel rows (that is ``4vouz``). It consumes the MISS results —
the list of orphaned archived stream records — and is invoked by the ``0i2vt.14``
integration umbrella, which threads the shared ``IdRemapTable`` / ``RollbackLedger``
/ ``RestoreReport`` through. The integration umbrella owns persisting the ledger
to disk after each create (the durable-write strategy lives in one place per the
``kxuj2`` contract); this module only mutates the in-memory models.

Conventions (``docs/style_guide.md`` / ``backend/CLAUDE.md``): ``snake_case``;
Google-style docstrings; lazy ``%`` logging with a ``[DBAS_RESTORE]`` prefix;
no bare ``re.*`` (this module builds no regex); imports the restore contracts
READ-ONLY.
