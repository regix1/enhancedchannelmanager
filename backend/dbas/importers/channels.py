"""The channels restore importer — channel-row create + profile reattach + streams.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-4vouz`` (split 2/4) created the channel-row +
profile-reattach layer; bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-0i2vt.14`` (the INTEGRATION
umbrella) extends it with the stream layer. This module restores the CHANNEL
entity category from a Dispatcharr export archive: it creates each archived
channel row, reattaches each channel to its archived channel-profile memberships,
AND re-attaches each channel's archived embedded streams to the destination.

THE STREAM LAYER (``0i2vt.14`` integration — wires the three sibling splits).
For each restored channel, the archived embedded ``streams`` are matched against
the destination instance's existing streams using the pure 4-tier matcher
(:func:`dbas.stream_matcher.match_stream`, bead ``al6e3``):

* Tier 1-4 HIT  -> the matched DESTINATION stream id is attached to the channel.
  The existing stream is NOT created and NOT ledgered (it already exists; only
  the attachment is new).
* MISS (tier 0) -> the archived stream is an ORPHAN. Orphans are collected across
  the WHOLE import and handed, ONCE, to
  :func:`dbas.custom_stream_fallback.synthesize_custom_streams` (bead ``ahygg``),
  threading one :class:`~dbas.custom_stream_fallback._FallbackState` so the
  synthesized custom-stream M3U account is found-or-created at most once. The
  synthesizer creates each orphan, ledgers it (``EntityType.STREAM``), records it
  in the remap, and WARNs. The synthesized destination ids are then attached back
  to the channels they came from.

ATTACH MECHANISM. A Dispatcharr channel's stream set IS an ordered list of stream
ids on the channel: ``client.update_channel(channel_id, {"streams": [ids…]})``
replaces the channel's stream list (verified against ``routers/channels.py`` —
reorder/merge use this same call). ORDERING is preserved by emitting the
destination ids in the archived stream order: each archived stream owns one slot,
filled with its matched id (immediately) or its synthesized id (after the batched
fallback resolves), then the whole ordered list is sent in one ``update_channel``.

create_stream (``nav0c``) is used ONLY inside the fallback synthesizer for
orphans; a matched stream is never created. The STREAM-category counts in the
report distinguish them: synthesized orphans land in ``created`` (ahygg), matched
existing streams in ``updated`` (attached-not-created).

FK remapping (the load-bearing correctness control). A Dispatcharr export records
each entity's id *as it was on the source instance*; on restore the destination
assigns its own ids. FK reference fields on a channel therefore point at SOURCE
ids and MUST be rewritten to DESTINATION ids (via the shared
:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.IdRemapTable`, populated by the groups/profiles
importer ``0i2vt.12``) before the create is sent — or the channel is skipped
``DEPENDENCY_UNRESOLVED`` rather than sent upstream with a stale archive id.

The channel FK fields and how each is handled:

* ``channel_group_id`` -> :data:`EntityType.CHANNEL_GROUP` — REMAPPED. Resolved
  through the IdRemapTable; unresolved => channel skipped DEPENDENCY_UNRESOLVED.
* ``stream_profile_id`` -> :data:`EntityType.STREAM_PROFILE` — REMAPPED. Same
  treatment.
SOURCE-ID COERCION. Every archive id this importer puts in the remap (and in
``created_source_ids``) goes through :func:`dbas.archive_keys.as_int`, the SAME
rule ``dbas/channel_reattach.py`` reads them back with. It used to be ``int()``
here and strict ``as_int`` there, and the two disagreeing was not cosmetic: a
channel whose id one side accepted and the other did not looked, to the reattach
pass, like a channel this restore had NOT created, so a PRESERVE run reported
"we left your existing channel alone" about a channel it had just made (PR review
round 2, finding 4). One rule, both sides — the same consolidation W3 applied to
the producer/consumer seam, applied to the importer/reattach seam.

* ``logo_id`` / ``epg_data_id`` -> NO EntityType in the restore contract. Logos
  and EPG data are owned by separate beads (logos: ``.15`` / ``.19``, surfaced
  via :attr:`RestoreReport.logo_misses`); there is no id namespace in the remap
  to resolve them. Sending the stale archive id would dangle a reference, so
  these fields are DROPPED from the create payload. (A later logo/epg bead
  reattaches them; this importer must not invent or forward a stale id.)

Channel-profile membership reattach. Channels belong to channel profiles. After a
channel is created, each archived membership is reattached via
``client.update_profile_channel(dest_profile_id, dest_channel_id, {"enabled": ...})``.
The destination profile id is resolved through the IdRemapTable
(:data:`EntityType.CHANNEL_PROFILE`, populated by ``0i2vt.12``). If the profile
is NOT in the remap (the channel-profiles importer did not run, or did not
restore that profile), the membership is handled as ``DEPENDENCY_UNRESOLVED`` and
recorded under the :data:`EntityType.CHANNEL_PROFILE` category — never crashing,
never guessing a profile id.

Collision taxonomy. A channel whose ``(name, channel_number)`` already exists on
the destination is skipped ``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL`` (never overwritten); its
source id is still remapped to the existing destination id so a later profile
reattach can resolve it. A create that races into an upstream uniqueness conflict
is failed ``CONFLICT``.

AMBIGUOUS NULL-NUMBER COLLISION (spike ``xp6mp`` DBA ruling 1a — UNIFORM fix).
``channel_number`` is OPTIONAL on a Dispatcharr channel. A ``(name, None)``
archived channel that "matches" a ``(name, None)`` destination channel is NOT a
proven identity — two distinct channels can share a name when neither carries a
number, so a silent ``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL`` would let a real, different
channel be skipped. Under the CONTINUOUS cross-instance sync that reuses this
importer (epic ``i39wu``, bead ``kcxie``) that silent skip becomes *permanent*
recurring divergence — B never converges on A's channel because every cycle the
ambiguous name-only key re-collides and is silently no-op'd. So a name match
where ``channel_number`` is null/absent on BOTH sides is surfaced as
``FailureReason.CONFLICT`` (a failed-with-reason in the report), never a silent
skip. This is a CORRECTNESS fix inside this one importer; it applies UNIFORMLY
(DBAS restore too — it was a latent one-shot bug). A NON-null number equality
match stays ``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL`` (a real channel-number IS a stable
identity).

Opt-in. The category does nothing unless the operator selected it (``selected``).

Integration with the restore contracts (bead ``kxuj2``): results land in the
shared :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreReport`
(:data:`EntityType.CHANNEL` category, plus :data:`EntityType.CHANNEL_PROFILE` for
unresolved memberships), created channels register source->dest in the
:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.IdRemapTable`, and every created channel is
recorded in the :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RollbackLedger` so a later
failure compensates by deleting it. This importer imports the contracts module
READ-ONLY.
