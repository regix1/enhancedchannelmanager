"""The ECM-settings restore importer — ECM's OWN ``settings.json``.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-dfkbn`` item 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WENT MISSING AND WHY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The drill (run 2026-08-04-run1) set two non-default ECM settings through the
Settings UI, backed up, wiped, and restored::

    user_timezone:        'America/Chicago'  ->  ''   (default)
    stats_poll_interval:  37                 ->  10   (default)

The restore report showed ``settings updated=7`` — which is why this reads as a
paradox until you know that category is
:data:`~dbas.restore_contracts.EntityType.SETTINGS`, DISPATCHARR's core-settings
namespace (``dbas.importers.settings_agents``). ECM's own settings are a
different thing entirely: the artifact builder DOES emit them
(``categories/settings.yaml``, via ``routers.backup._gather_settings``), but
``dbas.restore_artifact._SECTION_TO_ENTITY`` had no row for the section, so the
decoder dropped the whole blob on the floor and no importer ever existed. The
settings were not mis-applied; they were never read.

This module is the missing importer, and
:data:`~dbas.restore_contracts.EntityType.ECM_SETTINGS` is the category that
distinguishes it from Dispatcharr's.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IT WILL NOT WRITE (and why each exclusion is not optional)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **The live Dispatcharr connection** (:data:`CONNECTION_KEYS`). The restore is
   RUNNING against that connection: the orchestrator holds an authenticated
   client, the deferred phase is about to trigger an M3U refresh through it, and
   the placeholder rebind after that reads streams back over it. Repointing
   ``url`` / ``auth_method`` / ``username`` / ``password`` /
   ``dispatcharr_api_key`` mid-run would break the run that is applying them, and
   on a migrate-to-a-new-install restore it would overwrite the connection the
   operator just configured with the dead one from the old host. The operator
   sets this during setup; the archive does not get to move it.

2. **A redaction sentinel.** A STANDARD (redact-by-default) artifact carries
   ``***REDACTED***`` in place of every credential-class value. Writing that
   through would replace a WORKING secret with a placeholder that authenticates
   nowhere — strictly worse than leaving the value alone. Sentinel-valued keys
   are skipped and reported as a credential-re-entry action item, reusing the
   ``…-6pilh`` machinery (:func:`credential_sentinel.strip_redaction_sentinels`).

3. **Keys this build does not have.** An archive from a newer ECM can carry a
   setting this version's model does not define. It is dropped with a note
   rather than failing the category — an unknown key is a version difference,
   not a corrupt archive.

4. **Internal bookkeeping** (:data:`INTERNAL_KEYS`) — one-time heal markers that
   describe what has run on THIS install, not operator intent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOT LEDGERED, NOT ROLLED BACK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A setting is config, not a created entity: there is nothing to compensate-delete,
so nothing is written to the :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RollbackLedger` and
results land as ``updated`` / ``skipped``, never ``created``. This mirrors
``dbas.importers.settings_agents`` exactly — including the consequence, which the
orchestrator already surfaces: applied settings are NOT undone by a rollback.

Conventions (``docs/style_guide.md`` / ``backend/CLAUDE.md``): ``snake_case``;
Google-style docstrings; lazy ``%`` logging with a ``[DBAS-ECM-SETTINGS]``
prefix; a setting VALUE is never logged (several are credentials).
