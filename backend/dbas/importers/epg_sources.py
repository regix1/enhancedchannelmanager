"""The EPG sources restore importer — Phase-2, after M3U, before Channels.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-0i2vt.11``. EPG sources sit second in the hard
Phase-2 ordering (``M3U → EPG → Channels → Logos``; ADR-012 D-table): they are
restored AFTER M3U accounts (so an EPG source that references an M3U account can
remap that FK) and BEFORE Channels (so a channel's ``epg_data`` linkage — handled
by the channels/logos importers, NOT here — has its source rows to match
against). This module restores the EPG_SOURCE entity category from a Dispatcharr
export archive: the SOURCE rows only. EPG-to-channel linkage (``set_logo`` /
``epg_data`` on channels) is explicitly out of scope here.

It mirrors the established Phase-2 importer pattern (``importers/m3u_accounts.py``
/ ``importers/channels.py`` / ``importers/users.py``): opt-in, consumes the
shared restore contracts (:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.IdRemapTable`,
:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RollbackLedger`,
:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreReport`, the Skip/Failure taxonomy),
per-entity results, and dry-run support.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREDENTIAL HYGIENE (the bead .8 clear-text-logging lesson — read FIRST)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An EPG source can carry CREDENTIALS. An XMLTV source's ``url`` often embeds an
authenticated token; a Schedules-Direct source carries ``username`` /
``password`` (the password write-only, per ``docs/dispatcharr_api.md``). These
NEVER surface in a log line, a :class:`RestoreReport` label/note, a
:class:`RollbackLedger` entry, or a sanitized failure message. The ONLY fields we
log or report are SAFE: the source ``name``, the source ``source_type``, the
destination ``id``, counts, and status codes. We never log/echo a url, username,
password, or an upstream SDK exception body verbatim (an error body can echo the
url). The failure-message sanitizer below scrubs known credential markers
defensively and falls back to a generic message.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDENTITY / MATCH KEY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An archived EPG source is matched against the destination instance's existing
sources by a STABLE identity: ``(source_type, normalized name)`` — the
source_type discriminator plus the case-insensitive, whitespace-trimmed name.
Rationale: the name is the operator-facing identity Dispatcharr displays, and
including ``source_type`` prevents an ``xmltv`` "Sports" colliding with a
``schedules_direct`` "Sports". We deliberately do NOT key on ``url``: an XMLTV
url can embed a credential token, so matching on it would mean comparing (and
risking logging) credential-bearing strings. A match → skip
``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL`` (and the source id is still remapped to the existing
destination id so a later FK reference resolves). No match → create.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FK REMAP (m3u_account)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An EPG source may reference an M3U account (``m3u_account``) — e.g. a provider
that serves both the playlist and its EPG. That FK points at a SOURCE id and is
rewritten to the DESTINATION id through the :class:`IdRemapTable`
``M3U_ACCOUNT`` namespace (populated by the M3U importer ``.10``, which runs
first). An m3u_account reference that cannot be resolved is treated per the
contract as ``DEPENDENCY_UNRESOLVED`` — the source is skipped and never sent
upstream with a dangling source id. A null/absent m3u_account is NOT a dependency
(a free-standing XMLTV/SD source) and is created normally.

Integration with the restore contracts (bead ``kxuj2``): results land in the
shared :class:`RestoreReport` (``EntityType.EPG_SOURCE`` category), created
sources register source→dest in the :class:`IdRemapTable`, and every created
source is recorded in the :class:`RollbackLedger` for compensating deletes. This
importer imports the contracts module READ-ONLY.

    """Bounded 2-stage wait for Dispatcharr's EPG data download (restore apply).

    Bead ``kxcjf`` folds in the unmet ``0i2vt.11`` acceptance item: after the
    restore creates EPG sources, Dispatcharr downloads their EPG data
    asynchronously — the Channels importer must not run before that download so
    Dispatcharr's channel↔EPG matching has rows to match against. Mirrors the
    bounded 2-stage poll in ``m3u_accounts.apply_deferred_auto_sync``:

    1. **Trigger** — best-effort ``refresh_epg_source`` per created source (the
       create usually kicks a fetch itself; the explicit trigger makes the wait
       deterministic). A trigger failure is logged and never fatal.
    2. **Bounded poll** — re-read each source row until it is terminal
       (:func:`_epg_download_done`) or ``max_polls`` is exhausted. The row is
       checked BEFORE the first sleep, so an already-downloaded source costs
       zero waiting.

    Non-silent on timeout: a source that never reached a terminal state is
    returned with ``completed=False`` (the orchestrator reflects it into the
    :class:`RestoreReport` notes) and logged as a WARNING. Never raises, never
    hangs, never fails the restore — channels still restore without EPG data,
    just without upstream EPG matching.

    Args:
        source_ids: DESTINATION ids of the EPG sources created this run.
        client: The Dispatcharr API client.
        get_source_fn: ``async (source_id) -> dict`` row probe seam
            (defaults to ``client.get_epg_source``).
        refresh_fn: ``async (source_id) -> dict`` trigger seam
            (defaults to ``client.refresh_epg_source``).
        sleep_fn: ``async (seconds) -> None`` sleep seam (``asyncio.sleep``).
        poll_interval_seconds: Seconds between polls.
        max_polls: Hard upper bound on polls per source (never an infinite loop).

    Returns:
        Per-source summaries: ``{"epg_source_id", "completed", "status",
        "polls"}`` — safe fields only, never a url/credential.
