"""The settings/agents/DVR DBAS restore importer (Phase-2 bulk importer).

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-0i2vt.13``, extended by ``…-ciabe``. Restores FIVE
categories that split into TWO shapes. PLUGINS are EXCLUDED (ADR-012 D10 —
RCE-vs-config unresolved). USERS are restored by a SEPARATE crown-jewel importer
(``importers/users.py`` — bead ``…-l1p4p``); they are NOT touched here.

The whole DVR surface lives in this ONE module — rules and the recording
instances alike — because they share every helper that decides identity,
payload shape and failure classification. Splitting the recordings half into its
own file would have meant either duplicating those helpers or importing another
module's private names across a seam.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TWO SHAPES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENTITY categories — create rows, remappable, ledger-tracked (mirror
``importers/m3u_accounts.py``):

* **user_agents** (:func:`import_user_agents`) -> ``EntityType.USER_AGENT``.
  Identity by name. Create + register source->dest in the
  :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.IdRemapTable` + record in the
  :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RollbackLedger`. A name collision is skipped
  ``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL`` and remapped to the existing destination id so a
  DVR rule (or channel) that references it still resolves.

* **dvr_rules** (:func:`import_dvr_rules`) -> ``EntityType.DVR_RULE``. The
  upstream resource is Dispatcharr's RECURRING RECORDING RULE
  (``/api/channels/recurring-rules/`` — channel + weekly schedule); the category
  was retargeted there by ``…-lsa0s`` after its original ``/api/dvr/rules/``
  guess turned out to have no route at all. Identity is by name/title with a
  SCHEDULE fallback for unnamed rules (``name`` is optional upstream). Its
  ``channel`` FK is remapped through the IdRemapTable; an unresolvable FK is
  failed ``DEPENDENCY_UNRESOLVED`` — identically on apply and on dry-run, per the
  y6zg6 preview-parity rule — and never sent upstream with a dangling source id.
  Dispatcharr's SERIES rules are deliberately out of this category: they live
  inside the ``dvr_settings`` core-setting the ``core_settings`` category
  already carries.

* **upcoming_recordings** (:func:`import_upcoming_recordings`) ->
  ``EntityType.UPCOMING_RECORDING`` (bead ``…-ciabe``). The recording INSTANCES
  (``/api/channels/recordings/``) that have not started yet — the half of the DVR
  surface that used to be excluded wholesale, leaving a replica with no scheduled
  recordings at all. Identity is (destination channel, start instant, end
  instant); its ``channel`` FK remaps through the same namespace the DVR rule's
  does, and an unresolvable one is recorded through
  :meth:`RestoreReport.record_dependency_unresolved` so the blocked entity is
  NAMED and COUNTED rather than filed as a no-op skip. A row whose absolute start
  has passed since the backup was taken is skipped ``SCHEDULE_ALREADY_PAST`` —
  the destination refuses a past-dated create anyway. COMPLETED recordings never
  reach this importer: they are not archived at all, and the BACKUP producer
  reports that exclusion to the operator (ADR-013).

SETTINGS categories — APPLY key/value config; NOT entity-create, NOT
id-remapped, NOT ledgered as creates:

* **core_settings** (:func:`import_core_settings`) — apply the archived core/
  global settings to the destination one row at a time
  (``client.update_core_setting``). The archive carries key->value only, and
  Dispatcharr's detail route is keyed by an integer pk, so each key is first
  resolved to the DESTINATION's row id by the run-scoped
  :class:`CoreSettingIdResolver` — one ``GET /api/core/settings/`` per run,
  apply OR dry-run (bead ``…-q6xjl``; the previous key-string URL 404'd on every
  key). A key that resolves is ``updated`` (or ``would_update`` on dry-run); a
  key with no row on the destination is ``failed`` DEPENDENCY_UNRESOLVED on
  BOTH apply and dry-run (bead ``…-y6zg6``) — the preview resolves against the
  SAME destination the apply would, so a dry-run cannot certify WOULD-UPDATE for
  a key the apply then fails on. Reported on the ``EntityType.SETTINGS`` report
  category — never ``created``, never ledgered.
* **comskip** (:func:`import_comskip`) — same shape; a comskip config blob applied
  conservatively.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SETTINGS SAFETY — the conservative denylist (the highest-risk decision)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Core settings + comskip can carry credential / auth / instance-identity material
(API keys, SMTP passwords, signing secrets, the operator's own auth config).
Blindly PUTting the whole settings blob could reconfigure or offline the LIVE
instance mid-restore and clobber the operator's credentials with the archive
source's.

Policy — **DENYLIST, fail-safe**: a setting key is applied ONLY if it does NOT
match any marker in :data:`DANGEROUS_SETTING_KEY_MARKERS` (case-insensitive
substring match — see :func:`is_safe_setting_key`). A matching key is SKIPPED
and reported (by NAME only — never its value). The denylist errs toward NOT
applying: a key whose name contains any credential/auth/secret/identity marker is
left untouched, so the operator's live credentials are never overwritten by the
archive. Keys we do not recognize but that look benign (no dangerous marker) are
applied — these are config like ``default_user_agent`` / ``ui_theme`` /
``comskip_ini`` that are safe to carry across instances.

ROLLBACK OF SETTINGS IS OUT OF SCOPE (known limitation): a settings change is not
a created ENTITY, so there is nothing to compensate-delete. The ledger records
only created entities; applied settings are NOT ledgered and are NOT undone on a
later failure. This is a deliberate, documented limitation for v0.18.0.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREDENTIAL HYGIENE (the bead .8 + l1p4p lesson)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A setting VALUE may be a secret. This module NEVER logs a setting value and
NEVER puts a setting value into the :class:`RestoreReport`. The only things that
surface are SAFE: the setting KEY name (for the skipped-key audit), counts, and
status. Setting values are passed straight to the client and never echoed. The
entity importers carry no credentials (a user agent is a benign UA string; a DVR
rule is benign config), but failure messages are still sanitized defensively.

This module imports the contracts module READ-ONLY.

    THE INVARIANT, stated as a property rather than as the cases below::

        Never create a recording the destination already holds, never create one
        whose scheduled start has already passed, and never send a source
        instance's id upstream — an unresolvable reference is NAMED and COUNTED
        rather than silently dropped.

    Three consequences, in the order the loop reaches them:

    STALENESS IS CHECKED AGAIN AT RESTORE TIME, not only at backup time. The
    archive pins ABSOLUTE timestamps, and the time between the backup and the
    restore is exactly the interval over which "upcoming" stops being true — a
    week-old artifact can carry nothing but stale rows. The row is skipped
    :attr:`~dbas.restore_contracts.SkipReason.SCHEDULE_ALREADY_PAST`, which is a
    faithful absence and never a delivery shortfall: the destination REFUSES a
    past-dated create outright (``400 "End time must be in the future."``,
    measured on 0.29.0), so this is not ECM declining to deliver something the
    destination could have held. ECM's gate is on ``start_time`` where upstream's
    is on ``end_time``, so it is strictly the stricter of the two and can never
    hand upstream a create that validator would reject.

    THE ``channel`` FK RESOLVES THROUGH THE REMAP or the recording is not
    created. Recorded through :meth:`RestoreReport.record_dependency_unresolved`
    (bead …-4mkoe) rather than a bespoke counter, so the per-entity reason, the
    category count and ``entities_blocked_by_dependency`` are three views of ONE
    decision instead of three that can drift. That recorder is also what
    distinguishes the two opposite facts an unresolved FK can be — and a
    recording is a first-class entity the operator selected, so an unresolvable
    channel is a genuine shortfall in every case it can reach here.

    IDENTITY IS (channel, start, end) — see :func:`_recording_identity` for the
    two measured reasons ``custom_properties`` and string timestamps are excluded
    from it. A collision is skipped ``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL``, so restoring
    the same artifact twice schedules each recording once.

    Like its DVR-rule sibling the destination index is a SNAPSHOT taken once
    before the loop, so two identical recordings within ONE archive are both
    created — duplicating rather than clobbering, which is the safe direction.

    Every outcome above is reported IDENTICALLY on dry-run and on apply (the
    y6zg6 preview-parity rule): staleness is a fact about the clock and FK
    resolution is a fact about the run's remap state, and neither depends on
    whether this run is going to write. Opt-in via ``selected``.

    ``failed`` / ``failure_details`` are populated on BOTH apply AND dry-run
    (enhancedchannelmanager-y6zg6): whether a key resolves to a destination row
    id is a FACT about the destination, true regardless of whether this run
    actually applies, so the dry-run branch resolves each safe key through the
    SAME ``id_resolver`` the apply branch uses before deciding would-update vs
    would-fail. There is no separate ``would_fail`` counter — this mirrors the
    existing convention for per-item conflicts that are facts about the source
    data (see ``dbas/importers/channels.py``'s ambiguous-null-key collision and
    ``tasks/dbas_sync.py``'s ``_counts_from_report`` docstring). Before this fix,
    the dry-run branch never contacted upstream at all and unconditionally
    reported would_update, which is what let a preview certify "Settings 7 WILL
    UPDATE / 0 FAILED" for an apply that then failed 7/7 (q6xjl). NEVER ledgered
    (settings are config, not created entities — rollback of settings is out of
    scope). NEVER logs/echoes a setting VALUE.
