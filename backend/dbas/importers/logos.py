"""The logos restore importer — streaming upload + 3-tier match + hardened validation.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-0i2vt.15``. Logos are the LAST entity in the hard
Phase-2 ordering (``M3U → EPG → Channels → Logos``; ADR-012) and carry both the
largest memory/bandwidth profile AND the only untrusted-file-upload surface in
the restore. This module restores the LOGO entity category from a Dispatcharr
export archive.

It mirrors the established Phase-2 importer pattern (``importers/channels.py`` /
``importers/m3u_accounts.py``): opt-in, consumes the shared restore contracts
(:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.IdRemapTable`,
:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RollbackLedger`,
:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreReport`, the Skip/Failure taxonomy),
per-entity results, dry-run support, and credential-clean logging.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STREAMING UPLOAD (ADR-008 D8 — the OOM-avoidance headline requirement)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 50MB-per-logo cap × 2000 logos is a 100GB policy ceiling. The container is a
single process; it CANNOT hold that in memory. So this importer processes ONE
logo at a time: read its base64 string → decode to bytes → validate → upload →
let the bytes go out of scope BEFORE the next logo is read. There is never more
than a single decoded logo payload live at once — NOT a CumulativeMemoryTracker
port (rejected by D8). The decode is isolated in :func:`_decode_logo_bytes` so a
test can prove the read/upload interleave (one decode, one upload, repeat).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-TIER MATCH (the logoMap contract — pure resolver :func:`resolve_logo_match`)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An archived logo is reconciled against the destination instance's logos by THREE
strategies, in strict priority order — the first that hits wins:

* **(1) src** — ``src:{source_id}``: the archived logo's source id resolves
  through the :class:`IdRemapTable` ``LOGO`` namespace. Strongest signal.
* **(2) name** — ``name:{lower(original_name)}``: case-insensitive name equality
  against a destination logo. Tie-break = lowest destination id (deterministic).
* **(3) file** — ``file:{sanitized_basename}``: the sanitized filename basename
  equals a destination logo's basename (derived from its ``url``/``filename``).
  Tie-break = lowest destination id.

A match means the logo already exists on the destination: it is NOT re-uploaded
(``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL``), its ``source->dest`` id is recorded in the remap
so channel ``logo_id`` references can resolve, and nothing is ledgered (nothing
to roll back). A MISS uploads the logo (streaming), ledgers it and remaps it, and
increments the INTERNAL :attr:`LogoImportResult.misses` counter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT COUNTS AS A LOGO MISS (the operator-facing loss report)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

``LogoImportResult.misses`` above and :attr:`RestoreReport.logo_misses` are NOT
the same counter and must never be wired to each other:

* ``LogoImportResult.misses`` answers "did the destination already have this
  logo?". Internal bookkeeping. Never rendered to an operator.
* :attr:`RestoreReport.logo_misses` answers "did the operator LOSE this logo?".
  It gates the D9 red banner and the restore summary line.

The canonical definition, the rule for all three producers, and the history that
produced it live in ONE place: :meth:`RestoreReport.record_logo_miss`. Read it
before touching any miss-recording site. The short form for this module: record
a miss ONLY where a logo failed to come back (unreadable bytes, failed
validation, failed upload, failed URL re-create), NEVER on a path that restored
it, and record it through ``report.record_logo_miss()`` rather than by
incrementing the field.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECURITY VALIDATION (untrusted file upload — the security-review surface)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every logo passes FOUR validations BEFORE any upload; a failure is a per-entity
``VALIDATION_ERROR`` (sanitized message, no raw bytes/path), never a crash, and
never writes/uploads anything:

1. **Filename basename** — strip every directory component (POSIX ``/`` AND
   Windows ``\\``); reject empty / ``.`` / ``..`` / control-char names. The
   stripped basename is also a path-traversal guard: a ``../`` or absolute path
   collapses to nothing usable and is rejected (see :func:`_safe_basename`).
2. **Declared-size cap** — if the archive declares a ``size`` over 50MB, reject
   BEFORE decoding (don't buffer a blob we already know is over cap).
3. **Decoded-size cap** — after decode, the actual byte length is hard-capped at
   50MB (the declared size is advisory; the decoded length is authoritative).
4. **MIME magic-byte validation** — the decoded bytes' leading magic number must
   match a known image type (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/BMP). A ``.png`` file whose bytes
   are ELF/PE/script is a disguised binary and is REJECTED — the extension and
   the declared content-type are NEVER trusted. Magic checks are byte
   comparisons / membership tests (no regex on dynamic input — Semgrep clean).
   BMP is validated more strictly than a 2-byte prefix: it must carry the "BM"
   signature AND a little-endian file-size dword (offset 2) that equals the
   decoded byte length (LOW-1 hardening — a bare "BM…" blob is rejected). SVG is
   NOT an allowed type: it is XML/script-bearing, has no raster magic number, and
   does not match the allowlist, so it is rejected.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BULK-DELETE PRE-STEP (destructive — opt-in, never silent, never in dry-run)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When ``clear_existing=True`` AND not a dry-run, the importer clears the
destination's existing logos via ``client.bulk_delete_logos`` before uploading
the archive's logos. This is destructive, so it is OFF by default and never runs
in dry-run (grooming guard: a mid-delete failure must not leave Dispatcharr with
no logos and no replacements — so the delete is best-effort-logged and the upload
proceeds regardless; the operator opts into this explicitly).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREDENTIAL / PATH HYGIENE (the .8 / .13 clear-text-logging lesson)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logo bytes, raw filenames/paths, and upstream SDK exception bodies (which can
echo a logo url/path) NEVER reach a log line, a report label/message, or a
ledger entry. We log/report ONLY safe fields: the logo's display name, the match
tier, counts, and a failure-reason enum. :func:`_sanitize_failure` scrubs any
upstream message that smells like a URL/path before it lands in the report.

            base64 ``content_b64`` (the D1 binary subtree decoded into records).
        client: The Dispatcharr API client.
        selected: The per-category opt-in flag. ``False`` -> the whole category is
            skipped (no deletes, no uploads); each logo recorded
            EXCLUDED_BY_OPERATOR.
        report: The shared :class:`RestoreReport`; results land in the
            ``EntityType.LOGO`` category and feed :attr:`RestoreReport.logo_misses`.
        ledger: The shared :class:`RollbackLedger`; each UPLOADED logo is recorded
            for compensating deletes (a matched existing logo is NOT ledgered).
        remap: The shared :class:`IdRemapTable`. WRITTEN with each matched/uploaded
            logo's ``source->dest`` id under ``EntityType.LOGO`` so channel
            ``logo_id`` references resolve.
        is_dry_run: ``True`` -> nothing is deleted or uploaded; the importer only
            reports ``would_create`` / ``would_skip``.
        clear_existing: ``True`` -> run the DESTRUCTIVE bulk-delete pre-step
            (clear all destination logos before upload). OFF by default; NEVER
            runs in dry-run.
        archive_channels: The CHANNEL records from the export archive (bead
            cm9bi). Read-only channel context for the logo-miss drill-down:
            each miss lists the channels whose ``logo_id`` referenced it, with
            the destination channel id resolved through the CHANNEL remap
            namespace (populated by the channels importer, which runs earlier).
            ``None``/empty -> misses carry an empty channel list.
        content_provider: OPTIONAL lazy per-logo payload loader (bead
            ``7ipq2.1`` — the cross-instance sync path). When set, a MISSED
            logo whose record carries no ``content_b64`` is hydrated by
            awaiting ``content_provider(record)`` (must return the base64
            string, or ``None`` on failure) IMMEDIATELY before validation +
            upload — one logo at a time, so the D8 streaming guarantee holds
            for plans that are assembled METADATA-ONLY (holding every logo's
            base64 in the plan at once would defeat D8). The hydrated payload
            lives on a per-iteration COPY; the caller's record is never
            mutated (no accumulation). Cheap pre-checks (safe basename,
            declared-size cap) run BEFORE hydration so a logo that is already
            rejectable is never read. A provider failure (``None`` / raise) is
            a per-logo ``VALIDATION_ERROR`` with a path-free message, never a
            crash. Archive restore supplies this loader from its still-open,
            already-validated ZIP; legacy in-memory records still work with the
            default ``None`` because they carry ``content_b64`` directly.
