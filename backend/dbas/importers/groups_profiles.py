"""The bulk groups/profiles restore importer — Phase-2 leaf dependencies.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-0i2vt.12``. This module restores the THREE
leaf-dependency categories that the Channels importer (bead
``enhancedchannelmanager-4vouz``) consumes, together as one "bulk importer":

1. **Channel groups**   -> :data:`EntityType.CHANNEL_GROUP`
2. **Channel profiles** -> :data:`EntityType.CHANNEL_PROFILE`
3. **Stream profiles**  -> :data:`EntityType.STREAM_PROFILE`

Each category restores its archived rows and POPULATES the shared
:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.IdRemapTable` under its own EntityType. The
Channels importer reads those mappings to rewrite ``channel_group_id`` /
``stream_profile_id`` FK references and channel-profile memberships before
sending channels upstream. These three are LEAF dependencies — channels point at
THEM, so they must be restored BEFORE channels (the hard Phase-2 ordering:
``M3U → EPG → groups/profiles → Channels``; ADR-012). This importer only restores
its rows + populates the remap; the dependency ORDERING across categories is the
orchestrator's job (bead ``…-0i2vt.18``).

It mirrors the established Phase-2 importer pattern (``importers/m3u_accounts.py``
/ ``importers/channels.py`` / ``importers/users.py``): opt-in per category,
consumes the shared restore contracts
(:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.IdRemapTable`,
:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RollbackLedger`,
:class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreReport`, the Skip/Failure taxonomy),
per-entity results, and dry-run support. It imports the contracts module
READ-ONLY.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDENTITY / MATCH KEY (per category)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All three categories match an existing destination row by **name**,
case-insensitive and whitespace-trimmed (:func:`_norm_name`). This mirrors ECM's
existing upsert-by-name behaviour for channel groups (``backup.py`` —
``_restore_channel_groups``) and stream profiles, and is the only stable identity
these rows carry across instances (their numeric ids differ). On a name match the
row is SKIPPED and its source id is remapped to the EXISTING destination id so a
later FK reference resolves — NEVER the delete-all-then-recreate strategy, which
would destroy the very relationships the remap exists to preserve (kxuj2
contract; ADR-008 grooming note).

WHAT THE SKIP CLAIMS (bead ``…-3t74w``). Channel profiles and stream profiles
report ``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL``. **Channel groups do not**, because that
claim was never earned: a Dispatcharr channel group carries nothing but a name,
and its CONTENTS are the ``channel_group_id`` on the CHANNELS — restored after
this importer, so at match time there is nothing to compare. Drill run 12
(2026-08-07) built a target group named ``Drill Movies`` that was a genuinely
different object (different id, holding a different channel), watched the restore
adopt it, and read ``already exists identical`` and ``success / failed 0`` back.
Channel groups therefore report ``ALREADY_EXISTS_NAME_MATCH`` — the true
statement — and the CONTENT divergence is reported after the channels step as
:attr:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreReport.channel_group_drift`
(:func:`dbas.channel_reattach.reconcile_channel_groups`). The ADOPT and the FK
remap are unchanged: name is the identity, and the alternative (a
``CONFLICT`` failure) would cascade to ``DEPENDENCY_UNRESOLVED`` for every
channel pointing at the group and lose more than it reported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FK REMAP
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The generic per-category engine rewrites outbound FK references through the
IdRemapTable (unresolvable -> ``DEPENDENCY_UNRESOLVED``, never sent upstream with
a stale archive id).

Channel groups and channel profiles are genuine leaf dependencies with NO
outbound remappable FK — they do not reference another remapped entity; channels
reference them. Their :attr:`CategoryConfig.remappable_fk_fields` is empty.

STREAM PROFILES ARE NOT A LEAF (bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-lvfwd``). A
Dispatcharr stream profile carries a ``user_agent`` FK. This module previously
asserted the opposite and shipped an EMPTY ``remappable_fk_fields`` for the
category, so the archived SOURCE instance's user-agent id was POSTed verbatim at
the destination. Against a fresh Dispatcharr that 400s ("Invalid pk ... object
does not exist") and aborts the whole restore; against a destination that happens
to have an unrelated user agent at that id the create SUCCEEDS and silently binds
the WRONG agent. ``stream_profiles`` therefore declares
``{"user_agent": EntityType.USER_AGENT}`` and the orchestrator restores user
agents BEFORE stream profiles so the namespace is populated when this runs
(``dbas.restore_orchestrator.default_importer_steps``).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE-METHOD SHAPES (verify-then-size: all three client methods pre-existed)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ``client.create_channel_group(name)`` — takes a NAME STRING (not a dict). The
  engine passes the row's name; channel groups carry no other create fields.
* ``client.create_channel_profile(data)`` — takes a payload DICT.
* ``client.create_stream_profile(data)`` — takes a payload DICT.

The ``payload_style`` on :class:`CategoryConfig` selects which calling
convention the engine uses; no new client methods were required.
