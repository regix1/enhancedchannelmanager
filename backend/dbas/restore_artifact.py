"""Decode a new-format DBAS backup artifact into a restore :class:`ImportPlan`.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-o8tbv`` — the "round-trip gap" glue. Every
backend restore primitive existed before this module
(``validate_artifact_manifest`` .17, ``run_restore`` / ``run_dry_run`` .18/.16,
every importer .10-.15) but NOTHING turned an on-disk
:func:`routers.backup.build_backup_artifact` ZIP into the
:class:`~dbas.preflight.ImportPlan` the orchestrator consumes. This module is
that decode step, and it is the SINGLE place an untrusted uploaded artifact is
unpacked into structured records.

Decode pipeline (validate-before-decode, never the reverse)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. :func:`routers.backup.validate_artifact_manifest` runs FIRST (version gate +
   per-member SHA-256) and passes its parsed manifest to
   :func:`decode_artifact_to_plan`; decode never reads it a second time. The
   orchestrator then re-checks the
   schema-version a SECOND time in pre-flight (defence in depth — .17 + .18).

2. Per-category YAML (``categories/<section>.yaml``) is parsed and the entity
   list extracted from its ``dispatcharr.<section>`` / ``database.<section>``
   slice. Each artifact section maps to exactly one :class:`EntityType`.

3. The binary subtree (``binary/logos/<rel>`` + ``binary/metadata.json``) is
   decoded into metadata-only per-logo records. :func:`logo_content_provider`
   reads and base64-encodes one member only when the importer reaches that logo,
   so the plan never retains aggregate logo payloads.

ZIP-SLIP / PATH-TRAVERSAL SAFETY (the untrusted-upload surface)
---------------------------------------------------------------
This module NEVER extracts a member to the filesystem. It reads named metadata
members and streams only logo members it chose from the enumerated binary
subtree. Every member name pulled from the artifact's own listing is screened by
:func:`_is_safe_member` (reject absolute paths, ``..`` segments, and backslash
separators) before it is read, so a crafted archive entry can never widen the
read surface. The logos importer (.15) independently re-validates each filename
basename before any upload — defence in depth.

Conventions (``docs/style_guide.md``): ``snake_case``; Google-style docstrings;
lazy ``%``-formatted logging; no secrets in any log line.
