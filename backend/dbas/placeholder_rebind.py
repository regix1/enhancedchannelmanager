"""Rebind restored channels off URL-less placeholders onto the real streams.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-2o0cz`` (P0). This is the pass that makes a
restored lineup PLAY.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WENT WRONG (drill run 2026-08-04-run1, ECM 0.18.1-0022 / Dispatcharr 0.28.2)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At channel-import time the destination has no provider streams yet — the M3U
account was created moments earlier and its refresh is DEFERRED to the end of the
run (it would otherwise race the logo import). So the 4-tier matcher
(:func:`dbas.stream_matcher.match_stream`) MISSES every archived stream, and
:mod:`dbas.custom_stream_fallback` does the only safe thing available to it:
synthesizes each orphan as a URL-less placeholder under one synthetic M3U account
(``ECM Custom Streams (DBAS restore)``) and binds the channel to that.

Nothing ever undid it. The drill measured the consequence exactly: after the
deferred refresh materialized 110 REAL provider streams in under 10 seconds,
every one of the 12 channels was STILL bound to its placeholder. The restore
reported ``success … created 32, failed 0`` for an instance where not one channel
could play, and the runbook's documented recovery (an M3U refresh) provably does
not fix it — it adds the real streams beside the placeholders and rebinds nothing.

The matcher itself is fine: the drill CONFIRMED its ordering behaviour (a
three-stream channel restored in exactly its archived order, on both artifact
variants). The defect is that nothing re-runs it once there is something to match
against.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WENT WRONG NEXT (drill run 2026-08-05-run3, ECM 0.18.1-0024, bead
``enhancedchannelmanager-ixdaw``)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rebind above works — and then broke a channel a different way. A channel
seeded with ``TX | Dallas | PBS KERA``, ``TX | DALLAS | PBS KERA`` and
``TX | Austin | PBS KLRU`` came back holding three placeholders and returning
HTTP 500 with 0 bytes, while the restore still reported ``success, failed 0``.

The first two names differ ONLY in case. The matcher's normalizer folds case, so
Tier 2 (exact normalized name + same provider) is the correct answer for BOTH —
and it is the SAME answer, verified against the live destination:

    'TX | Dallas | PBS KERA' -> tier=2 match_id=101
    'TX | DALLAS | PBS KERA' -> tier=2 match_id=101   <-- same id
    'TX | Austin | PBS KLRU' -> tier=2 match_id=98

This pass wrote both slots and PATCHed ``streams=[101, 101, 98]``. Dispatcharr
rejected the whole update::

    psycopg.errors.UniqueViolation: duplicate key value violates unique
    constraint "unique_channel_stream"
    DETAIL:  Key (channel_id, stream_id)=(12, 101) already exists.

Because the PATCH is all-or-nothing, the handler below reverted the ENTIRE
channel to placeholders — including the KLRU slot that had a perfectly good
unique match. One colliding slot cost every slot.

The matcher is NOT wrong here: it is a PURE function returning the best match for
ONE archived stream, and it has no view of what its siblings claimed. Uniqueness
is a property of the LIST, so the de-dup belongs to the caller that assembles it.
Hence ``claimed_ids`` below: a match landing on an id the channel already holds
is demoted to a MISS, keeping that one slot on its placeholder (counted and named
like any other miss) so the PATCH can never carry a duplicate. Archived ORDER is
untouched — the demoted slot stays exactly where it sat.

RUN-4 UPDATE (bead ``…-ixdaw``, drill run 2026-08-05-run4): the matcher now
resolves the case-differing pair ITSELF. Its exact-name tiers prefer a candidate
whose RAW name is byte-identical to the archived name, so
``'TX | DALLAS | PBS KERA'`` and ``'TX | Dallas | PBS KERA'`` land on the two
DISTINCT destination ids that actually exist instead of collapsing onto the lower
one. ``claimed_ids`` is therefore no longer the primary handling for that shape —
it is the BACKSTOP, and it stays exactly as written. It remains the only defence
against a GENUINE collision (two archived streams whose raw names are truly
identical), which no pure per-stream matcher can resolve and which must still
cost one slot rather than the whole channel.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHERE THIS RUNS AND WHY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ARCHIVE-DRIVEN pass (:func:`rebind_placeholder_streams`) is a
RESTORE-COMPLETION step in :func:`dbas.restore_orchestrator.run_restore`,
immediately AFTER the deferred phase and only on a clean, non-dry-run apply.
That placement is forced:

* it cannot run inside the channels importer — the real streams do not exist yet;
* it cannot be left to the operator — the drill proved the documented manual
  recovery (refresh) does not rebind, so "the operator will refresh" is a
  recovery path that does not work;
* it must run after ``apply_deferred_auto_sync`` — that is the call that
  triggers the refresh and polls until the destination stream count stabilizes,
  which is precisely the moment the real streams are queryable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY ONE SHOT IS NOT ENOUGH (bead ``…-2o0cz`` residual, drill runs 4, 5 AND 7)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The placement above is correct and still insufficient for the artifact most
operators hold. On a STANDARD (redacted) artifact the restored M3U account has
no credential at the moment the deferred phase runs, so its refresh materializes
NOTHING and the pass above has nothing real to match against. Three drill runs
measured the identical three-step recovery::

    1. straight after the restore   14 streams (0 with url)  all placeholder  0/n, HTTP 500
    2. + re-enter the credential
       and refresh                 110 streams (96 with url) STILL all placeholder  0/n, HTTP 500
    3. + re-run the WHOLE restore    96 streams (96 with url) all REAL  4/4, 200, 262144 B

Step 2 is the recovery an operator reaches for FIRST, and it changed nothing
they could see: the 96 real streams materialized and sat BESIDE the placeholders.
Step 3 — re-running an entire restore purely to re-trigger a rebind — is
non-obvious and nothing in the product said to do it.

:func:`rebind_placeholders_after_refresh` makes step 2 sufficient. It is the
SAME pass with a different way of naming what each placeholder slot should
become, and it needs NEITHER the archive, the ledger NOR the id remap — all of
which are gone once the restore ends. The enabling fact is that
:mod:`dbas.custom_stream_fallback` builds each placeholder FROM the orphan
record, carrying the archived stream's own ``name`` verbatim (drill run 6
observed a placeholder named ``DRILL ORPHAN STREAM (source only)`` — the
archived name byte-for-byte). So the placeholder is its own match key: the pass
re-runs :func:`dbas.stream_matcher.match_stream` with the PLACEHOLDER'S OWN
RECORD as the archived stream. Its ``url`` is empty (Tier 1 skipped) and its
``m3u_account`` is the synthetic one (Tier 2 misses), so it resolves on Tier 3 —
the exact-normalized-name rung, which carries the ``…-ixdaw`` RAW-NAME
PREFERENCE, so the case-differing pair still lands on two DISTINCT ids here.

Both entry points share ONE per-channel implementation
(:func:`_rebind_one_channel`) and ONE cleanup pair
(:func:`_sweep_orphaned_placeholders` / :func:`_drop_empty_synthetic_account`).
There is deliberately no parallel implementation to drift: the ``…-ixdaw``
``claimed_ids`` de-dup, the in-place slot rewrite that preserves archived ORDER,
and the all-or-nothing PATCH failure handling are written once and used by both.

WHERE THE REFRESH-DRIVEN PASS IS HOOKED, and what that covers:

* ``routers.m3u._poll_m3u_refresh_completion`` — the completion path of
  ``POST /api/m3u/refresh/{account_id}``. This is the UI "Refresh" button and
  the MCP ``refresh_m3u`` tool, i.e. THE step-2 route the drill measured.
* ``tasks.m3u_refresh.M3URefreshTask`` — once per task run, after every account
  has been refreshed. This is the scheduled sweep and the manual "run task"
  button, so an instance heals on its own cadence even if the operator reached
  materialized streams by a route below.

NOT covered, stated plainly rather than overclaimed: ``POST /api/m3u/refresh``
(refresh-all, and the MCP ``refresh_all_m3u`` tool) returns the instant it has
triggered the upstream refresh and exposes no completion signal to hang the pass
on; direct ``DispatcharrClient.refresh_all_m3u_accounts`` callers
(``stream_prober``); and a refresh performed in Dispatcharr's own UI. An
instance reaching materialized streams only by one of those heals on the next
scheduled ``m3u_refresh`` run, not immediately.

DOUBLE-RUN SAFETY. Two independent guarantees:

* STRUCTURAL — the restore's deferred phase calls
  ``DispatcharrClient.refresh_m3u_account`` DIRECTLY
  (:func:`dbas.importers.m3u_accounts.apply_deferred_auto_sync` step 3), never
  ECM's own ``POST /api/m3u/refresh/{account_id}`` route and never the
  ``m3u_refresh`` task. So a restore cannot trigger either hook, and the
  orchestrator's own call is the only rebind a restore performs.
* EXPLICIT — :data:`_REBIND_LOCK` serializes every entry point. The
  archive-driven pass WAITS for it (it is the authoritative pass and must never
  be skipped); the refresh-driven pass SKIPS when it is already held, because a
  rebind that is already in flight is doing exactly the work it would do. The
  check and the acquire have no ``await`` between them, so in a single event
  loop the pair is atomic. This also covers two concurrent refresh completions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IT DOES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Read the placeholder ids this run created from the shared
   :class:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RollbackLedger` (``EntityType.STREAM``). Only
   streams THIS restore synthesized are ever touched — never a pre-existing one.
2. Re-fetch the destination's streams and build TWO sets from them, because
   WRITE AUTHORITY and DETECTION are different questions (bead ``…-kcfru``, and
   see its section below). The REAL candidates — everything this run did NOT
   synthesize whose url CAN SERVE — are the only things a slot may be rebound
   ONTO. The playable ids — EVERY stream whose url can serve, whoever made it —
   are what step 5's verdict is taken against. A stream with no usable address is
   in neither: it is exactly the thing we are rebinding away from. "Can serve" is
   :func:`credential_sentinel.url_can_serve`, NOT truthiness — see "A DEAD
   ADDRESS IS NOT ALWAYS AN ABSENT ONE" below.
3. For each restored channel, re-run the SAME 4-tier matcher over the real
   candidates, one slot per archived stream in archived order. A hit takes the
   real id; a miss keeps the placeholder so the channel is never left with fewer
   streams than it had. A hit landing on an id the channel ALREADY holds is
   treated as a miss (see the run-3 section above). The channel is PATCHed only
   when the ordered list changed.
4. Delete every placeholder that is no longer referenced by any channel, then
   SWEEP the residue an earlier run left behind, then drop the synthetic account
   if nothing is left under it. See "THE RESIDUE" below.
5. Report what is left, in TWO populations (bead ``…-daziw``). A channel holding
   any slot that is NOT a real destination stream with a usable address — OR
   holding no slot at all (bead ``…-15g1j``) — is counted in
   :attr:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreReport.channels_needing_stream_reattach`
   and NAMED in ``stream_reattach_details``. A channel left with NOT ONE stream
   that can serve is additionally counted in
   :attr:`~dbas.restore_contracts.RestoreReport.channels_with_no_playable_stream`
   and flagged ``has_playable_stream=False`` on its detail row — that is the
   population that CANNOT PLAY, and the only one that downgrades the restore
   outcome. The distinction matters because the run-3 de-dup above deliberately
   leaves ONE slot on its placeholder while the channel keeps its real streams:
   that channel plays, and calling it a failure would false-fail the very fix
   that saved it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THE VERDICT IS NOT KEYED ON THIS RUN'S PLACEHOLDERS (bead ``…-oebpv``,
drill run 2026-08-05-run4)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5 used to be nested inside "did THIS run's placeholder survive?", so the
whole verdict was skipped for a channel whose bad slots were left by an EARLIER
restore. Run 4 measured it twice: a repeat restore over an already-stranded
``KERA Dallas PBS`` reported ``channels_needing_stream_reattach: 0``,
``channels_with_no_playable_stream: 0`` and an empty ``notes[]`` for a channel
that answered HTTP 500 on playback.

The verdict is now taken for EVERY restored channel, from what it is ACTUALLY
left holding, against ``playable_ids`` — every destination stream whose address
can serve. Who created a bad slot is irrelevant to whether the channel plays. A slot that
streams nothing is named from the destination's own stream list, so a prior run's
placeholder gets its real name rather than ``<unknown>``. A channel whose every
slot streams something is healthy and is not reported at all.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AND NOT ON HAVING SLOTS TO REBIND EITHER (bead ``…-15g1j``)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The same fusion as ``…-kcfru`` below, one step earlier, and it survived that
fix untouched because it never reached the verdict to be corrected by it. The
per-channel loop opened with an emptiness guard::

    current_ids = current_by_channel.get(dest_channel_id)
    if not current_ids:
        continue

The guard was right about the REBIND — a channel holding no streams has no slot
to re-match, and running the matcher over it could only bind it to streams the
archive never put on it. It was skipping the VERDICT with the work, so a
destination channel holding NOTHING, which self-evidently cannot play, scored 0
in both counters and was never named. Three routes in
:mod:`dbas.importers.channels` reach that state: ``_plan_streams`` produces no
plan for an archive channel carrying no ``streams``, and ``_attach_streams``
either ``continue``s without a PATCH when every synthesize failed or leaves the
channel empty when its ``update_channel`` raises.

Two changes, and each is load-bearing on its own (both were confirmed by
mutation — reverting either alone re-hides the channel):

* only a channel that is not on the destination AT ALL is skipped now
  (``current_ids is None``), which is a different fact and not this pass's to
  report — the channel importer already recorded it, and naming it here would
  put an unopenable channel id in ``stream_reattach_details``. A channel holding
  an EMPTY LIST falls through, and ``_rebind_one_channel`` does nothing with it:
  no slots to walk means ``rebound`` stays 0 and it returns above its PATCH.
* the verdict's trigger adds ``undelivered``, because "some slot cannot play" is
  VACUOUSLY FALSE for a channel with no slots. Stated as the invariant it was
  always meant to be: a channel is reported when it holds a slot that streams
  nothing OR when the archive carried streams for it and it holds none. Zero
  streams is one example of the second, not its definition.

WHAT THE EMPTY CASE IS QUALIFIED ON, AND WHY IT IS NOT "EVERY EMPTY CHANNEL".
This counter means "the restore did not deliver a channel that plays", so
something has to have been UNDELIVERED — hence ``archived_by_source``. A channel
the ARCHIVE carries no streams for was never going to arrive with any: the
replica is FAITHFUL, not stranded, and the note's instruction ("attach a real
stream to each channel named") would be telling the operator to make the replica
DIVERGE from its source, on every unattended cycle, forever. That is the same
crying-wolf shape ``…-kcfru`` was filed to stop, arrived at from the other side.
It is also not hypothetical: the cross-instance sync round-trip harness seeds
exactly that channel (``{"name": "CNN", "channel_number": 5, "streams": []}``),
and counting it unconditionally turned all ten of that suite's keystone
scenarios from ``success`` into ``completed_with_failures`` for a replication
that had lost nothing. ``tests/dbas/test_restore_unplayable_channels.py`` pins
both halves — the undelivered channel IS reported, the faithful one is NOT.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DETECTION AND WRITE AUTHORITY ARE DIFFERENT SETS (bead ``…-kcfru``, xdmru
two-instance validation 2026-08-20)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The section above is the right principle; step 2 quietly broke it in the other
direction, because ONE set was doing TWO jobs. ``candidates`` is the match-TARGET
set — it excludes this run's ledgered placeholder ids so a slot can never be
rebound onto a placeholder — and the playability verdict was read straight off
it. So "this run created it" silently meant "it cannot play".

That is only invisible while every synthesized placeholder is URL-less, which is
the REDACTED artifact. :mod:`dbas.custom_stream_fallback` builds each placeholder
from the orphan record and forwards its ``url`` (it drops only ``id`` / ``pk`` /
``m3u_account``), so a FULL-fidelity archive — which is what CROSS-INSTANCE SYNC
carries — synthesizes URL-BEARING streams that stream exactly what the source
streams. Sync target ``XDMRU B`` measured the consequence on five consecutive
cycles::

    run  9 (01:17:53)  created 18  channels_with_no_playable_stream: 6
    run 11 (01:19:56)  created  0  channels_with_no_playable_stream: 0
    run 13, 21, 22     created  0  channels_with_no_playable_stream: 0

B's six channels held the SAME six stream ids under the synthetic account for all
five, each carrying A's own provider URL. Playback decided which reading was
honest, by fetching rather than inferring::

    A /proxy/ts/stream/1e946091-…  ->  HTTP 200, 188 bytes
    B /proxy/ts/stream/bb66da76-…  ->  HTTP 200, 188 bytes

B plays. The creating cycle was crying wolf, and every cycle after it was right
by accident — the same stream was judged twice and got opposite answers purely on
whether the current run's ledger happened to hold it.

The two concerns are now two sets, and the split is the fix:

* ``candidates`` — WRITE AUTHORITY. Unchanged, and still ledger-scoped: only a
  stream this run did NOT synthesize, whose address can serve, may be rebound
  onto, and only ledgered ids are ever rebound away from or deleted. Widening
  THIS is the obvious wrong fix — it would let a run mutate streams it did not
  create. (Bead ``…-1td94`` NARROWED it, which is the safe direction: a stream
  with a redacted address is no longer a rebind TARGET.)
* ``playable_ids`` — DETECTION. Read-only and UNSCOPED: every destination stream
  whose address can serve, whoever made it. Nothing is written from it.

The invariant it buys, which a single-apply test cannot check and which is why
the regression tests run the pass TWICE: the verdict is a function of the
DESTINATION'S STATE alone. Two cycles over an unchanged destination return the
same answer. A channel that streams nothing downgrades EVERY cycle, not just the
one that stranded it — an unattended schedule must not go green over a replica
that has stopped playing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A DEAD ADDRESS IS NOT ALWAYS AN ABSENT ONE (bead ``…-1td94``, measured live on
Dispatcharr 0.29.0, 2026-08-20)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything above says "carries a URL" and means "can be streamed". Those were the
same sentence for as long as the only way a placeholder could fail to play was
having no ``url`` at all. Bead ``…-msqf7`` ended that. An Xtream Codes stream URL
authenticates by PATH SEGMENT, so redacting the credential without discarding the
address — which is deliberate, so the operator can still see which provider and
which stream it was — produces::

    http://provider:9191/live/***REDACTED***/***REDACTED***/53.ts

That is a non-empty string, so ``s.get("url")`` said PLAYABLE. Fetching said
HTTP 404. Read from B's Postgres and by fetching, never from the run's report::

    53 of B's channels bound to streams whose upstream returns HTTP 404
    channels_with_no_playable_stream: 0

So the report called a replica entirely healthy while 90 percent of it could not
play — the same class of silence ``…-kcfru`` and ``…-oebpv`` each closed by a
different route, reached this time through the PREDICATE rather than through
provenance or control flow.

THE FIX IS THE PREDICATE, NOT A SENTINEL TEST PER SITE. Every question of the
form "does this stream have a usable address?" in this module now goes through
:func:`credential_sentinel.url_can_serve`. Five sites ask it — the two candidate
sets, ``playable_ids``, the post-refresh placeholder gate and the residue sweep —
and the point of routing them through ONE named function is that the next reason
an address is dead is added once, there, instead of being missed at four of five
call sites. The invariant is "a channel bound to a stream that cannot serve is
reported unplayable, WHATEVER the reason the address is dead"; the redacted URL
is one example of it, not the specification.

NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR FETCHING, and the counter must not be read as one. This is
the narrower question ECM can answer offline: is this an address at all, or is it
ECM's own record that there is not one? An address that is well-formed and simply
revoked still reads as playable here and always will.

WHAT DID NOT CHANGE: the redaction. ``…-msqf7`` closed a real credential leak
whose own live proof showed 53 provider passwords reaching B, and the trade it
made — a safe stream that cannot play, over a playable stream that ships the
password — stands. What was missing was the run SAYING so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE RESIDUE (bead ``…-dgnms``, drill runs 2026-08-05-run4 AND run5)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4 above deleted only the placeholders in THIS run's ``RollbackLedger``, and
dropped the synthetic account only when THIS run had created it. Both conditions
are about provenance, and provenance turns out to be the wrong question for
cleanup. Two measured consequences, neither an outage — every channel played —
but both accumulating on every redacted restore cycle:

* **14 URL-less placeholder streams bound to NO channel.** They were created by
  an EARLIER restore and superseded when a later one rebound their channels onto
  real streams. Nothing referenced them again, and nothing this run owned
  referenced them either, so nothing ever deleted them.
* **The synthetic account survived while empty.** Run 5 rebound and deleted every
  placeholder (``14 placeholder(s) deleted``, ``0 channel(s) still hold a slot
  that cannot play``) and the M3U account list still showed
  ``ECM Custom Streams (DBAS restore)`` — this run had REUSED the account rather
  than created it, so the ledger held no entry and the drop no-oped.

Both are fixed by asking the state question instead of the provenance question,
and BY KEEPING every safety condition that is about state:

* :func:`_sweep_orphaned_placeholders` deletes a stream only when it is on the
  synthetic account AND carries no url AND no channel references it. An
  operator's own URL-less stream on a DIFFERENT account is untouched; so is any
  placeholder a channel still holds.
* :func:`_drop_empty_synthetic_account` deletes the account only when NO stream
  remains under it, verified against the destination's own stream list. The
  "never delete an account that still has streams" property — the one that stops
  a cascade from cutting channels this run never touched — is unchanged.

The ledger-scoped guarantee that governs REBINDING is likewise unchanged: only
streams this run synthesized are ever rebound, and only they are deleted by the
ledger-owned pass. The sweep is a strictly additional, strictly narrower pass.

BEST-EFFORT BY CONSTRUCTION: every upstream call here is post-create cleanup on
an otherwise-successful restore. A failure is logged and surfaced as a report
note; it never raises, never fails the restore, and never triggers a rollback of
state the operator would rather keep.

LEDGER: deleted placeholders are deliberately left in the ledger. Compensation
treats a 404 as success (already gone), so a later rollback of an entry this pass
removed is a no-op — cheaper and safer than mutating rollback state from a
success path.

Conventions (``docs/style_guide.md`` / ``backend/CLAUDE.md``): ``snake_case``;
Google-style docstrings; lazy ``%`` logging with a ``[DBAS-REBIND]`` prefix; no
stream URL is ever logged or reported (a provider URL embeds credentials).

    """Rebind leftover restore placeholders once an M3U refresh materialized streams.

    THE FIX for the ``…-2o0cz`` residual (module docstring, "WHY ONE SHOT IS NOT
    ENOUGH"). On a redacted artifact the restore's own rebind runs against an
    account that has no credential yet and therefore no streams, so it resolves
    nothing; the operator then re-enters the credential and refreshes, and until
    now that changed nothing they could see. This is the pass that makes that
    second step sufficient, without the archive, the ledger or the id remap —
    each placeholder carries the archived stream's own name and is its own match
    key.

    CHEAP NO-OP. M3U refresh is a hot, scheduled path, so the pass gates itself
    twice before doing any real work and logs NOTHING on either exit:

    1. no M3U account named
       :data:`~dbas.custom_stream_fallback.CUSTOM_STREAM_ACCOUNT_NAME` exists —
       ONE ``get_m3u_accounts`` call, and the steady state on any instance that
       has never restored or that a previous pass already tidied (the empty
       account is dropped, so this stays false afterwards);
    2. the account exists but holds no unservable stream — one account-scoped
       stream page on top.

    Only past both gates does it fetch the full stream and channel lists.

    THE SAFETY ENVELOPE is exactly the one PR #784 established for the residue
    sweep, reused rather than re-derived: a stream is a rebind candidate ONLY
    when it sits on the synthetic account AND carries no url. An operator's own
    unservable custom stream on ANY OTHER account is never rebound, never counted
    and never deleted.

    Never raises — every failure path inside is logged and swallowed, and the
    callers (an M3U refresh completion) must not fail because a hygiene pass did.

    Args:
        client: The Dispatcharr API client.
        trigger: Operator-facing name of what invoked the pass (e.g. the account
            name, or the task id), used only in logs so the drill log says WHICH
            refresh healed the instance.
        allow_fuzzy: Whether the matcher may use its Tier-4 fuzzy rung. Defaults
            to ``True``, matching the restore path this is finishing.

    Returns:
        A :class:`RebindResult` describing what changed. All-zero when either
        gate short-circuited or a rebind was already in flight.

    THE PREDICATE — a stream is swept only when ALL FOUR hold:

    1. it sits on the synthetic ``CUSTOM_STREAM_ACCOUNT_NAME`` account (an
       account ECM itself creates for exactly this purpose and puts nothing else
       under);
    2. its url CANNOT SERVE — absent, or carrying the redaction sentinel (a
       servable stream on that account is not a
       placeholder — it is something that can actually play, and nothing here
       deletes a playable stream);
    3. NO channel references it, taken from the post-rebind reference set;
    4. this run has not already deleted it via the ledger-owned pass.

    Every one is necessary, and the conjunction is the narrowest predicate that
    still catches the measured residue. Drill runs 4 AND 5 finished the redacted
    round trip with 14 URL-less streams bound to NO channel, because the
    ledger-owned deletion above can only see placeholders THIS run created:
    a placeholder from an EARLIER restore, superseded when a later restore
    rebound its channel onto a real stream, is never referenced again and was
    never cleaned up. The instance accrued dead rows on every redacted cycle.

    WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT SWEPT, and why the predicate is not widened:

    * an unservable stream on ANY OTHER account — an operator may legitimately
      keep their own custom URL-less streams, and this pass has no business
      classifying those. The account test is what keeps the sweep to streams ECM
      itself synthesized, and widening the URL half to ``url_can_serve`` (bead
      ``…-1td94``) does not touch it: without that widening a credential-redacted
      placeholder survived every sweep, so each healed cycle left its dead rows
      behind for the matcher to keep tripping over;
    * a placeholder a channel still holds — that binding is load-bearing, and
      cutting it is precisely the outage the rebind pass exists to prevent;
    * anything at all when the synthetic account cannot be identified — the set
      is empty and this function is a no-op, never a guess.

    BEST-EFFORT: a failed delete is logged and skipped; nothing raises, nothing
    fails the restore, nothing triggers a rollback.

    Returns:
        The destination ids actually deleted.

    THE SAFETY PROPERTY IS UNCHANGED, and it is the emptiness test: an account
    that still has streams under it is NEVER deleted, because deleting it
    cascades those streams away from channels this run did not touch. That
    reasoning is sound and this function keeps it verbatim.

    What relaxes is only WHO CREATED IT. The previous implementation walked the
    :class:`RollbackLedger` for an ``M3U_ACCOUNT`` entry and no-oped when there
    was none, so an account created by an EARLIER restore and merely REUSED by
    this one survived forever — drill run 5 emptied it completely
    (``14 placeholder(s) deleted``, ``0 channel(s) still hold a slot that cannot
    play``) and still found ``'ECM Custom Streams (DBAS restore)'`` in the M3U
    account list. Who created an empty account has no bearing on whether it
    should still exist.

    Emptiness is verified against the LIVE INSTANCE — the destination's own
    stream list this pass fetched, minus the ids this pass has since confirmed
    deleted — never against the ledger, which knows only about this run.
