"""bead enhancedchannelmanager-jy006 — what ``require_auth: false`` still refuses.

THE QUESTION THIS BEAD ANSWERED
-------------------------------

``require_auth: false`` is a real, supported ECM operating mode, not a bug
state. What that mode's blast radius SHOULD be had never been decided. In
practice it meant every ``Require*IfEnabled`` gate in ``auth/dependencies.py``
short-circuited to "anonymous is fine", so an anonymous LAN caller on such an
instance could replace the entire database, plant a persistent admin-equivalent
``mcp_api_key``, and install their own TLS private key.

THE PO'S DECISION (2026-08-13)
------------------------------

Gate exactly three IDENTITY PRIMITIVES even when ``require_auth`` is false.
Everything else stays open in that mode and is documented in
``docs/auth_middleware.md`` → "What ``require_auth: false`` permits".

    require_auth: false
      /api/settings, /api/channels, /api/streams, /api/journal -> open
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
      POST /api/backup/restore-initial      -> admin required
      POST/DELETE /api/settings/mcp-api-key -> admin required
      /api/tls certificate + key material   -> admin required

The line between the two halves is not "how destructive is it". POST
/api/settings and POST /api/backup/restore are both wide open in this mode and
both do serious damage. The line is DURABILITY OF THE RESULTING IDENTITY: each
of the three primitives leaves the caller holding a credential or a key that
keeps working after the operator turns authentication back on. A settings write
does not.

THE FOLLOW-UP DECISION (2026-08-15, bead 2u4e0)
-----------------------------------------------

The twelve connection-test routes on ``RequireHumanAdminForOutboundTest`` join
them, on a SECOND axis:

    POST /api/settings/test, /test-smtp, /test-discord, /test-telegram
    POST /api/settings/{emby,plex,jellyfin}/test-connection
    POST /api/alert-methods/{id}/test
    POST /api/m3u/digest/test
    POST /api/cloud-targets/test, /api/cloud-targets/{id}/test
    POST /api/tls/test-dns-provider                       -> admin required

That axis is CREDENTIAL ORACLE, not durability: each route reaches the network
with credentials ALREADY STORED on the instance, to a host the caller can often
name, and echoes the upstream verdict back. The caller spends a secret they
never had to learn and reads an in-band port scan off the reply. jy006 left the
family open because the decision it implemented named none of these, and the
residual it produced was incoherent inside one router — ``POST
/api/tls/test-dns-provider`` was drivable anonymously on an owned auth-disabled
instance while ``GET /api/tls/settings``, which discloses the same
DNS-provider credentials only MASKED, was refused. ``TestOutboundTestFamily``
below now pins the refusal that ``TestEverythingElseStaysOpen`` used to pin as
an open residual.

The operator cost was shown to the PO and accepted: on an auth-disabled
instance that HAS a user account, a browser that is not signed in gets 403 from
every Test Connection button in Settings. Signing in at ``/login`` (bead p388h)
restores them without touching ``require_auth``, and the no-identity carve-out
leaves the headless posture alone.

THE NO-IDENTITY CARVE-OUT
-------------------------

All three gates still serve an anonymous caller on an instance that holds NO
operator identity — no user row and ``setup_complete`` false. That is a genuine
first run, or a deliberately headless auth-disabled deployment. Without it,
"always require an admin" would make these routes permanently unreachable on
such an instance with no in-band recovery: the only way to obtain an admin
would be to run the setup wizard, which changes the posture the operator chose.
The shape is not invented here — it is the one already shipped and
security-reviewed under bead lf29s in ``routers.backup._guard_initial_restore``,
whose predicate is now the shared
``auth.dependencies.instance_has_operator_identity``.

WHAT THIS FILE COVERS
---------------------

Every branch of the new ``enforce_when_auth_disabled`` behaviour, against the
real routes rather than the dependency in isolation:

* auth ENABLED — unchanged (the pre-existing per-bead files still own the
  detailed non-admin / MCP cases; the case here is a regression tripwire).
* auth disabled, NO operator identity — allowed, by both identity signals.
* auth disabled, identity present, anonymous — refused.
* auth disabled, identity present, authenticated non-admin — refused.
* auth disabled, identity present, admin — allowed (proves it is a refusal of
  anonymity, not of the mode).
* auth disabled, identity present, MCP service principal — refused, and the
  403 still names the right surface.

``restore-initial``'s half of the same decision lives in
``tests/routers/test_backup.py::TestRestoreInitialIdentityGate`` because that
route is guarded in the handler, not by a dependency; the cross-check that both
halves read the same predicate is ``test_both_halves_share_one_predicate``
below.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Primitive 3 — the /api/tls certificate and key material
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Applied to the WHOLE ``RequireHumanAdminForTLSMaterial`` set — all ten routes,
# including ``GET /settings``, ``DELETE /certificate`` and the https trio — not
# to the key-install subset alone. Reasons, in the order they carried weight:
#
#  1. It costs the operator nothing. ``TLSSettingsSection.tsx`` makes NO API
#     call at all when it renders non-admin (its ``useEffect`` returns at
#     ``if (!isAdmin) return``), and an auth-disabled instance is already in
#     that state — ``useAuth`` never resolves a user when ``require_auth`` is
#     false, so the section is handed ``isAdmin={user?.is_admin ?? false}``.
#     Nothing that works today stops working.
#  2. Splitting the set needs a SECOND gate constant with its own 403 body and
#     its own inventory group, which
#     ``tests/test_admin_gate_inventory.py`` explicitly argues against under
#     "WHERE THIS INVENTORY IS DELIBERATELY COARSER THAN ITS OWN PROSE": add
#     field- or route-level branching only when a concrete caller needs it.
#  3. Coarse fails in the safe direction.
#
# The two status reads (``GET /status``, ``GET /https/status``) keep plain
# ``RequireAdminIfEnabled`` and therefore stay OPEN in this mode; they disclose
# no credential material. ``POST /test-dns-provider`` used to stay open with
# them, on ``RequireHumanAdminForOutboundTest`` with its eleven siblings; bead
# 2u4e0 closed that whole family on 2026-08-15, and it is now pinned as a
# REFUSAL by ``TestOutboundTestFamily`` below.
