"""Bulk commit refuses a plan whose COMBINED final numbering is illegal.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-ic884.2``. These are the cross-operation cases
per-operation validation cannot see: every operation in the collision requests
below is individually legal against the lineup, and only the whole plan puts
two channels on one number.

``validateOnly`` is used throughout so the assertion is about the pre-execution
gate itself rather than about anything the executor did or did not do — the
same gate the asynchronous path passes through before its first mutation.

    Edit Mode's Apply is not one request: creates go up in their own call, then
    everything else in batches of 200. So phase 1 can legitimately show a
    collision that a phase-2 operation resolves — create a channel on 5 while a
    later batch moves the incumbent off it — and refusing phase 1 outright would
    break a plan that is fine as a whole.

    The split that resolves it, pinned here because it is the kind of
    interaction that breaks silently:

    * The BROWSER holds the whole plan, so its preflight
      (`frontend/src/utils/channelNumberPlan.ts`) is the binding gate for the
      UI, and it blocks before the first request — proven in
      `e2e/edit-mode-numbering-guards.spec.ts` by a request count of zero.
    * The SERVER sees one request at a time. Under ``continueOnError`` — which
      is exactly what Apply All sends — its finding is advisory and execution
      proceeds, matching how every other validation issue already behaves.
      Making numbering the one exception would change approved behaviour for a
      plan that is legal.
    * Without ``continueOnError``, which is the default and what a non-UI
      caller gets, it blocks.

    """The check runs whenever the batch places a channel, not only when a
    channel it can name in advance is real.

    Fix round 4. Which batches fetched the lineup was decided by a SECOND
    flag, ``numbering_needs_lineup``, raised only by a create carrying an
    explicit number. Every other numbering operation relied on the channel it
    names being real and therefore already in ``referenced_channel_ids`` — and
    a temp id is never added there, because a temp id names no existing
    channel. So a batch whose only numbering operation named a temp id fetched
    no lineup, reported ``numbering_preflight_unavailable``, and under the
    default ``continueOnError`` REFUSED a request that was perfectly legal.

    Reachable without consolidation at all — create a channel with no number
    and then renumber it — and reachable through consolidation for any create
    whose number a later operation owns, since that create is now emitted
    without one.

    ``numbering_places_a_channel`` is the whole condition now: a batch that
    places a channel needs the lineup to check the placement against, and a
    batch that places nobody needs nothing.
