"""The STANDARD DBAS artifact carries no identity or credential of any kind.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-gi4zn``. PO decision 2026-08-05: the standard
(non-encrypted, default) backup is FULLY redacted.

THE PROPERTY THESE TESTS PIN
----------------------------

    A standard DBAS artifact contains no value that identifies or authenticates
    against a THIRD-PARTY service, AND no credential material of the operator's
    OWN — hashes included.

    Redaction FAILS CLOSED: if any part of the scrub cannot run or cannot parse
    its input, the affected data does not ship.

Not "the username field on an M3U account is redacted" — that is one example of
the property. The drill (``~/ecm/backup-restore-runs/2026-08-05-run3``, finding
F4) found the XC username in clear beside a correctly-redacted password, and the
project's recurring failure mode is fixing the demonstrated case and leaving the
class open (see ``CLAUDE.md`` -> "State review acceptance criteria as invariants,
not reproductions"). So the assertions below are written against the whole
artifact: every seeded identity/credential sentinel is scanned for across EVERY
decompressed member, including ``journal.db``, rather than against the two YAML
keys the drill happened to read.

The second clause was added on 2026-08-17 after an external security review
built a standard artifact and read the operator's own bcrypt admin hash, their
session and reset-token hashes, their administering IP and user agent, and their
OIDC subject and identifier straight out of the archived ``journal.db``. The
first clause alone did not cover the admin hash — it is the operator's own
credential, not a third party's — and the PO ruled it in scope anyway, because
the entire purpose of a redacted artifact is being safe to share. The third
clause was added at the same time: the scrubber's three error paths each shipped
the RAW database or the RAW row.

AVAILABILITY IS PART OF THE PROPERTY
------------------------------------

A restored instance nobody can log into is a worse outcome than the leak. See
``routers.backup._AUTH_IDENTITY_TABLES`` for why the account rows are DELETED
rather than masked, and the RESTORE BEHAVIOUR section at the foot of this file
for the two destination states and what the operator re-establishes in each.

WHY A USERNAME IS A CREDENTIAL HERE
-----------------------------------

For an Xtream Codes provider the username is half the credential pair and the
half that identifies the SUBSCRIPTION — ECM renders XC stream URLs containing
it. A standard artifact is the default artifact, it is what an operator attaches
to a support ticket, and the user guide describes it simply as "redacted".

WHAT MUST STILL SURVIVE, AND WHY EACH EXCEPTION IS NARROW
---------------------------------------------------------

* ``dispatcharr_users[].username`` — the operator's OWN Dispatcharr instance,
  not a third party, and the natural key
  ``dbas.importers.users`` creates and collision-checks on. Redacting it would
  delete a shipped restore path and protect nothing that leaves the operator's
  trust boundary. The exemption is one named category (see
  ``routers.backup._IDENTITY_EXEMPT_CATEGORIES``), and
  :func:`test_dispatcharr_users_username_survives` is what stops it widening.
* A URL with no embedded credential — the restore needs it to recreate the
  account/source at all.
* The ENCRYPTED (``include_credentials``) artifact — its whole value is that it
  carries secrets safely, and the migration card depends on it.

# instance nobody can log into is a worse outcome than the leak. Two destination
# states, and the answer differs because the right answer differs:
#
#   * destination HAS accounts -> its own accounts survive the restore, so an
#     admin restoring a backup is not logged out of their own instance;
#   * destination has NONE (fresh container, DR rebuild) -> nothing is
#     re-asserted, ``users`` stays empty, and ECM's shipped first-run setup takes
#     over. That is what the operator re-establishes: their ECM account.
#
# These run against REAL SQLite files rather than mocks, because the defect being
# guarded is about what is in a database file.

# followed by ``://`` the engine re-scans the remainder of the run from every
# starting position inside it — quadratic in the length of the run. Measured on
# the pattern as committed: 1k chars 0.63 ms, 8k 42 ms, 32k 639 ms, 128k 10.2 s,
# a clean x4 per doubling.
#
# The input is unbounded and operator-controlled. ``_scrub_credential_urls``
# runs over every string cell of every table
# ``routers.backup._STANDARD_ARTIFACT_TABLES`` permits, and two of those carry
# free text with no length bound anywhere in the stack:
# ``ffmpeg_profiles.config`` and ``dummy_epg_profiles.description_template`` are
# both ``Column(Text)`` (``models.py``), their request models declare
# ``Optional[str] = None`` with no ``max_length`` (``routers/dummy_epg.py``),
# and SQLite does not enforce ``String(n)`` widths at all. So ADR-005's
# false-positive dismissal path (b) is unavailable — there is no sanitizer to
# reference — and (c) does not apply because this is production code. The
# resolution is (a) remediation.
#
# The scheme is now recovered by walking BACKWARDS from the ``://`` separator
# (``routers.backup._find_urls_in_text``) instead of being matched forward, so
# each run is visited once and the scan is linear. Both halves of that are
# pinned below, because either one alone is satisfiable by a broken fix: the
# shape corpus pins that every URL the scrub caught before it still catches,
# and the cost tests pin that it got cheaper without doing so.
