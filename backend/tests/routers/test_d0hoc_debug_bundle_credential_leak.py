"""The debug bundle carries no provider credential VALUE (bead …-d0hoc).

THE INVARIANT UNDER TEST, stated as a property rather than as the shapes that
exposed it:

    No provider credential value appears anywhere in a debug bundle, at any
    path shape, in any member file, at any nesting depth.

NOT "``/live/`` URLs are scrubbed", and NOT "``_XC_PATH_RE`` matches more
shapes". The defect that motivated this file was measured live on 2026-08-23:
``POST /api/auto-creation/debug-bundle`` produced a tar.gz whose ``channels.csv``
and ``channels.json`` each held 316 copies of the operator's real Xtream Codes
username AND password, as ``https://example.com/live/<user>/<pass>/13580.ts``.
``obfuscate.py``'s ``_XC_PATH_RE`` anchored on a THREE-segment path
(``/user/pass/id.ext``); Dispatcharr renders four (``/live/user/pass/id.ts``),
plus ``/movie/``, ``/series/`` and ``/server1/live/...``. The pattern never
matched, so the credential branch never ran — while the hostname WAS replaced
with ``example.com``, which is why the output looked obfuscated.

Every test here drives the REAL bundle builder (:func:`_build_debug_bundle`) and
byte-scans every member of the produced archive. Asserting against
``obfuscate_url`` directly would prove only that one function's behaviour; the
claim is about the artifact an operator attaches to a support ticket.

The credential values are SYNTHETIC. No real credential belongs in this repo.
