"""A journal row is QUEUED at the moment its write lands, not on the way out.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-kz089``, fix round 3. Round 2 put the journal
*flush* behind a single unavoidable ``finish()``. That was necessary and not
sufficient: ``finish()`` can only write rows that were already queued, so every
path that mutated upstream and then failed before reaching the row construction
still lost the row. Three of the reviewer's five findings were that one gap.

The invariants this file pins, as properties rather than as the three
reproductions that exposed them:

1. Every upstream mutation that LANDS produces a journal row, whatever fails
   afterwards, on every path — including a helper that performs several
   independent writes and fails partway (``reparent_group_channels``) and a
   write that happens *inside* an operation which then fails as a whole (the
   catalog logo a ``createChannel`` creates before the channel).
2. It is not expressible in code to record a mutation as persisted without
   queueing its journal row: :meth:`OperationLedger.record_persisted` and
   :meth:`OperationLedger.record_write` both REQUIRE a ``journal_row``, and the
   ledger owns the queue, so there is no second way to enqueue one and no way
   to skip it by accident. Saying "this write has nothing to journal" is a
   deliberate, named statement — ``nothing_to_journal(reason)`` — not an
   omission.
4. A lookup that FAILED never accuses an operation of referencing a missing
   entity. Round 2 gave the profile and hidden-group lookups that guard; the
   channel and stream lookups still read their own emptiness as proof of
   absence.

(Invariant 3 is the frontend's, pinned in
``frontend/src/hooks/useEditMode.stagedGroups.test.ts``.)

# ==========================================================================
# Fix round 4
#
# Two findings, both of which defeat an invariant round 3 was written to
# establish rather than adding a new one.
#
# 5. `nothing_to_journal` is reachable ONLY when nothing was written, or when
#    what was written genuinely has no journalable content. Round 3 made the
#    row a required ARGUMENT of saying a write landed, so a row cannot be
#    forgotten — but whether a row is OWED was still decided by
#    `describe_channel_update`, which recognised eight fields while the
#    operation carries a free-form `data` bag that is PATCHed upstream whole.
#    An unrecognised field changed the channel and the executor said there was
#    nothing to journal.
# 6. The flush survives cancellation. `asyncio.CancelledError` is a
#    BaseException, so the executor's `except Exception` never saw it and
#    `finish()` never ran: a landed write's queued row died with the task.
#    Application shutdown is the ordinary case, not an exotic one.

    Round 4 gave the executor a ``finally`` so a ``CancelledError`` could not

    ``Exception``, and so do ``write_journal_rows`` and
    ``journal.log_entries`` — so a synchronous dependency raising a
    ``BaseException`` AFTER ``drain_journal_rows()`` had emptied the queue lost
    the drained rows AND replaced the ``CancelledError``, leaving a task that
    had been cancelled reporting something else entirely.

    The flush chain is synchronous end to end (``flush_journal`` ->
    ``write_journal_rows`` -> ``journal.log_entries`` -> a blocking SQLAlchemy
    commit), so a nested cancellation cannot be injected mid-flush; this is
