"""Round 3 on ``enhancedchannelmanager-ftidn`` / ``-kz089``: the row has to be
true, not just present.

Round 2 moved row construction in front of the awaits that could lose it. That
was the right move and is unchanged here. What it introduced is two ways for a
row to exist and be WRONG, plus one way for an exception to be replaced while
the rows are being written. All three are stated below as properties; the
scenario in each test is an example of the property, not its specification.

**Property 1 — a row is finalised from the outcome, never asserted before the
outcome is known.** ``assign-numbers`` computed ``starting_number + idx`` in
front of the null check, so a request that omits ``starting_number`` (which
asks Dispatcharr to choose, and which the client passes through unchanged)
raised ``TypeError`` on ``None + 0`` after the assignment had already landed
upstream — a 500 with the queue empty and no row even attempted. Dispatcharr's
own ``POST /api/channels/channels/assign/`` declares no response body beyond
"Channels have been auto-assigned!" (``swagger.json``), so the numbers it chose
are not in the response and have to be READ BACK.

**Property 2 — the row describes what happened, on every branch.** bulk-merge
queued a row saying ``Merged {n} channels into '{target}'`` at the moment the
target PATCH landed, and source ``DELETE`` failures are swallowed with
``continue``. Target patched + every delete failing therefore produced a row
claiming a completed merge while every source channel still existed. Mutating
``deleted_ids`` by reference updates the id list and corrects neither the
action nor the prose. The zero-write branch appended the same sentence for a
group where nothing at all had happened.

**Property 3 — an exception already unwinding is never replaced by one raised
while cleaning up.** ``write_journal_rows`` re-raises ``BaseException`` by
design. A handler already unwinding a ``CancelledError`` that then hits a
``SystemExit`` from the synchronous journal dependency inside its ``finally``
had the original REPLACED — turning a disconnected or cancelled request into
worker termination. This is the same precedence guard the bulk-commit executor
carries (``unwinding_base_exception``); the reasoning that a request handler
had no analogue was wrong.

        the guard's whole risk is over-reach — a bare ``except BaseException:
        pass`` would uncancel a task on the ordinary return path — and on these
        three handlers the success path flushes INLINE, so this is where a
        flush failure with nothing in flight is reachable at all.

        ``BaseExceptionContainmentMiddleware`` (GH #546) converts an escaping
        ``SystemExit`` to ``RuntimeError`` before it can kill the event loop,
        so the assertion is on the CAUSE: the ``SystemExit`` reached the edge
        rather than being swallowed inside the handler.
