"""The dvr_rules backup category, exercised across the real HTTP seam (lsa0s).

Every other DVR test in the suite mocks ``DispatcharrClient`` itself, so none of
them could catch the defect this bead fixes: ECM asked for ``/api/dvr/rules/``,
a path Dispatcharr 0.28.2 has no route for, and Dispatcharr answered the SPA
shell (200 ``text/html``) instead of a 404. ``get_dvr_rules()`` then died in
``response.json()`` and :func:`_gather_dispatcharr_sections` converted that into
a ``{"_warning": "Dispatcharr not connected — ..."}`` stub, so EVERY backup run
silently shipped a category with no data in it.

These tests therefore build a REAL :class:`DispatcharrClient` over an
``httpx.MockTransport`` that reproduces Dispatcharr 0.28.2's routing behaviour —
including the SPA catch-all — using the recorded fixture
``tests/fixtures/dispatcharr_dvr_recurring_rules_recorded.json`` as the source
of truth for what each path answers. That is the only layer at which a wrong
PATH is provable; a mocked client would happily return rows for any path at all.

KNOWN FIXTURE GAP (PR #768 review, Warn 2): the recorded instance had no
recurring rules, so no populated rule row was captured and ``_LIVE_RULE`` below
is built from the recorded OpenAPI schema's field set. One field's wire shape —
``days_of_week`` as a JSON array of ints 0-6 — is asserted from Dispatcharr's
serializer rather than captured; see the fixture's
``capture.known_gap_no_populated_rule`` for the basis and the re-record trigger.
