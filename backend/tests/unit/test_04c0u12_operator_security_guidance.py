"""Executable contracts for security-critical operator guidance (04c0u.12).

Every assertion here pins a *documented claim* to the *code that makes it
true*, so the two cannot drift apart silently. A doc that says "the MCP key
cannot take a backup" is worthless the day that stops being enforced, and
nothing else in the suite notices — the docs are not otherwise executable.

Each test reads a live object — a route table, a capability set, a dependency
gate, a defaults dict, a dataclass, a port constant — and then asserts the
document agrees with it. The prose half of that pairing is a substring search,
necessarily; what makes it more than a grep is that it never stands alone.
Changing the behavior fails these tests, which is the point: the failure is the
reminder to change the prose.

Two assertions are prose-only and honest about it:
``test_every_documented_bullet_is_a_sentence_the_guide_actually_carries`` keeps
the route mapping's keys pointing at real guide text, and the
restored-account/legacy-ZIP tests check that the runbook still states in words
what their live-object assertions prove.
