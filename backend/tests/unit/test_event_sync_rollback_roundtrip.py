"""Event Sync rollback/snapshot end-to-end verification (SRE ship-blocker,
bead enhancedchannelmanager-ti939.2.3).

Proves the recovery mechanisms for event_sync attach runs rather than
assuming the pre-existing snapshot machinery covers the new path:

* **Snapshot/rollback round trip** — a manual attach run captures a
  pre-mutation ChannelPipelineSnapshot that INCLUDES the event master-group
  channels; ``rollback_execution`` (confirm-gated, delegating to
  ``restore_snapshot``) removes every attachment the run made and NEVER
  deletes the master channels themselves (ECM never created them).
* **Streams-only master restore** (PR #616 review nit): channels flagged
  ``event_sync_master`` at capture time are restored with a STREAMS-ONLY
  payload — Dispatcharr owns their name/group/epg/tvg and updates them in
  place across refreshes (slot renames), so writing captured metadata back
  would revert Dispatcharr-owned state to stale pre-run values with no
  guarantee Dispatcharr self-heals before the source stream next changes.
  Unflagged channels (standard-rule snapshots, legacy pre-flag snapshots)
  keep the full-payload restore byte-identical.
* **Surgical unmerge preferred over snapshot full-replace** (bead sfysz):
  when the journal (category=event_sync, batch_id=execution id) fully
  covers the run's attaches, a confirmed rollback removes ONLY the stream
  ids the run added — preserving Dispatcharr's own stream churn between
  run and rollback, which the snapshot full-replace would clobber with
  stale ids Dispatcharr never self-heals. Falls back to the snapshot
  restore when coverage cannot be proven (missing/partial journal, mixed
  runs, non-merge modifications). Confirm gating is unchanged.
* **No group-settings writes** — an AST scan of every event_sync code path
  proves no code writes Dispatcharr group settings (Phase 1 never toggles
  ``auto_channel_sync``; snapshot restore therefore never needs to either).
* **Circuit breaker** — the channel-pipeline breaker (bd-exo4j: the startup
  crash-sentinel abandons runs left 'running' and trips the persisted
  run-on-refresh flag) covers event_sync runs: their executions are ordinary
  ChannelPipelineExecution rows, so a crashed attach run trips the breaker;
  the reset endpoint clears it; and a tripped breaker gates ONLY the
  unattended auto-fire chain — a deliberate manual event_sync run is never
  gated (by design: manual "Run Now" is the operator's recovery surface).
