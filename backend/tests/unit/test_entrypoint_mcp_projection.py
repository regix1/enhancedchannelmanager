"""Preflight preparation of the MCP credential projection (…-04c0u.8).

``docker-compose.mcp.yml`` mounts a dedicated named volume at
``MCP_SECRETS_DIR`` in the **ecm** service. Docker creates a new named volume's
root as ``root:root 0755`` and a bind mount arrives owned by whatever host uid
made it, so after ``entrypoint.sh`` drops to ``gosu appuser`` the backend
cannot create ``api-key`` or ``mcp-service.json`` there.

That is not a degraded sidecar. ``backend/main.py`` materializes the private
projection inside the FastAPI startup handler, and an exception out of a
startup handler aborts the ASGI lifespan — uvicorn logs "Application startup
failed. Exiting." and the container never serves. The same call also runs in
the auth middleware on every non-exempt request, so an unwritable projection
directory is a 500 on every authenticated request as well.

``prepare_mcp_projection_dir()`` closes that by creating, chowning and
chmodding the directory while the entrypoint is still root, and by turning a
genuine failure into a named preflight error instead of an unhandled stack
trace at import time.

Layer note: shell-level behavioral tests over the real ``entrypoint.sh``. The
function takes its owner and its probe runner as parameters precisely so these
tests can drive it without root or ``gosu`` — no new operator-settable
environment seam is introduced (contrast ``ECM_MOUNTINFO``, bead
``enhancedchannelmanager-nz8q4`` item 2).
