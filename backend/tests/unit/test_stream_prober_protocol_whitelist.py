"""Regression tests for the ffmpeg/ffprobe protocol whitelist in stream_prober.

Background: ppe28.1 added -protocol_whitelist to ffmpeg_builder/probe.py and
routers/stream_preview.py but missed the scheduled probing path in
backend/stream_prober.py (_run_ffprobe and _detect_black_screen). Bead v3xfl
closed that gap. These tests exist so that any future refactor of those cmd
arrays that drops the whitelist fails loudly in CI — the string-level assertion
is intentional. Do not "soften" these assertions without re-doing the threat
model: the whitelist is the control that stops file://, concat:, subfile:,
data:, etc. from being dereferenced against the ECM host.

GH-106 update: tls and crypto were missing from the whitelist, which broke
every HTTPS stream ("Protocol 'tls' not on whitelist"). tls is the TLS
handshake chained from https; crypto is the HLS AES-128 segment demuxer.
Neither is a user-supplied URL scheme, so they do not widen the attack
surface relative to the original threat model.
