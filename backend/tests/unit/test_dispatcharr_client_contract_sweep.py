"""Contract sweep: every Dispatcharr URL template the client issues must exist.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-ax0kf`` / **ADR-014** (`docs/adr/ADR-014-dispatcharr-api-drift-strategy.md`).

ECM's Dispatcharr REST client was written against a *guessed* surface, and the
guesses shipped: ``enhancedchannelmanager-q6xjl`` (a key-string settings URL
that 404s on every restore key) and ``enhancedchannelmanager-lsa0s``
(``/api/dvr/rules/``, a path that exists on no Dispatcharr version and returns
the SPA shell as ``200 text/html``). Both were single-path bugs found by an
operator, not by CI.

This module closes the *existence* class of that bug for the whole client at
once. It walks ``backend/dispatcharr_client.py`` with :mod:`ast`, derives every
``(HTTP method, URL template)`` pair the client can issue, and checks each one
against a recorded manifest of the live Dispatcharr OpenAPI document
(``tests/fixtures/dispatcharr_openapi_paths_manifest.json``, produced by
``scripts/record_dispatcharr_openapi_manifest.py``).

**What it proves:** the path exists upstream, the method is allowed on it, and
the number/type of path parameters lines up.

**What it deliberately does NOT prove:** request or response *shape*, field
names, semantics, or query parameters. That is the job of the deep recorded
fixtures (``dispatcharr_openapi_recorded.json``,
``dispatcharr_core_settings_recorded.json``,
``dispatcharr_dvr_recurring_rules_recorded.json``), which pin a few high-risk
paths literally. A green sweep means "no endpoint is imaginary", not "the
integration works" — see ADR-014 Consequences.

**The extraction is derived from source, never hand-copied**, and any path
expression it cannot resolve is a LOUD test failure rather than a silent skip.
A partial sweep that reports green would recreate, in miniature, the exact
failure this bead exists to fix: a claim of coverage that was never real.

The whole check is hermetic — it reads a recorded fixture and never contacts a
Dispatcharr instance.

    Every function in the module is walked — top-level functions and the methods
    of every class at any nesting depth — so coverage does not depend on the
    calls living in one particular class.

    Three kinds of call site are extracted:

    1. ``self._request("<METHOD>", <path expression>, ...)`` — the shared path.
    2. ``self._get_json_bounded(<path expression>, ...)`` — the bounded-stream
       helper, which forwards its first argument to httpx as a GET.
    3. ``self._client.<verb>(<url expression>, ...)`` — the raw login /
       token-refresh posts, whose ``f"{self.base_url}/..."`` prefix is stripped.

    Four kinds of *seam* are recorded in ``raw_call_sites`` instead, because
    their URL is not readable here; each must be registered in
    ``_REVIEWED_RAW_CALL_SITES`` or it fails a test:

    * a non-verb call on ``self._client`` (``request``, ``send``, ``build_request``…),
    * constructing an httpx client (``async with httpx.AsyncClient() as c: …``),
      matched on the RESOLVED import binding so ``hx.AsyncClient()`` and a
      renamed ``AC()`` are the same seam,
    * binding ``self._client`` to anything — any target shape, including an
      attribute (``self._raw = self._client``), a tuple element
      (``c, _ = self._client, None``), a walrus, or chained targets — which
      would otherwise let ``await c.get(url)`` slip past the attribute match,
    * a request-issuing call on one of the other HTTP libraries in
      ``_KNOWN_HTTP_MODULES`` (``requests.get(url)``).

    ``self`` itself is tracked through local aliases (``s = self``), so calls
    made on one resolve normally rather than disappearing. Anything
    unresolvable — including a ``_request`` on a receiver that cannot be
    identified as the client — is recorded in ``unresolved`` so the caller can
    fail loudly.

    * An ``int``-annotated interpolation against an upstream parameter that
      declares a ``format`` (``string``/``uuid`` being the shape a primary-key
      migration produces) is REAL drift — the client would build a URL upstream
      can no longer route. Dispatcharr 0.28.2 already serves five ``uuid`` path
      parameters, so this check is not hypothetical.
    * An ``int``-annotated interpolation against a bare ``string`` parameter is
      NOT drift. drf-spectacular emits an untyped ``string`` for path converters
      that carry no declared type (custom ``@action`` routes and the ``/proxy/``
      surface); twelve of the parameters ECM interpolates are like that on
      0.28.2 and every one of them is an integer pk in practice. Flagging those
      would be twelve permanent false positives — noise that trains readers to
      ignore the sweep.

    An interpolation annotated as anything but ``int`` — ``str``, or nothing at
    all — is skipped entirely. That is a KNOWN BOUNDARY, not an oversight to
    read as coverage: a ``str`` interpolated into a parameter upstream declares
    as ``integer`` is the ``q6xjl`` root cause B shape and would pass here.
    Turning that direction on needs a false-positive survey of the client's
