"""Unit tests for ``DispatcharrClient.fetch_logo_image``
(bead enhancedchannelmanager-xb58a).

Dispatcharr is ECM's source of truth for logo images, including the ones ECM's
own Logo Manager uploads (those land in Dispatcharr's ``/data/logos/``, never in
ECM's config volume). The DBAS backup builder archives those bytes by asking
Dispatcharr for them at gather time, and this is the read it makes.

Mocking pattern follows the sibling direct-client unit tests: construct a real
``DispatcharrClient`` and patch ``_request``, so the endpoint, the return
parsing, and the error handling are exercised without a live HTTP round-trip.
