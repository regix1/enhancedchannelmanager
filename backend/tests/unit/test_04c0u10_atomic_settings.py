"""Durability, serialization and secrecy tests for shared ``settings.json``.

Bead enhancedchannelmanager-04c0u.10. ``settings.json`` holds plaintext
credentials and is read by the MCP sidecar out of a shared volume, so the
writer has to behave like ``backend/auth/settings.py`` does for
``auth_settings.json``: serialize writers, write a private temporary file,
fsync it, atomically replace, then fsync the directory.

Two groups of tests live here on purpose:

* ``TestAlreadyGuaranteed`` pins behaviour ``save_settings`` ALREADY had — the
  temporary-file/atomic-replace write that arrived with the MCP credential
  rotation work. These are characterization tests: they pass before and after
  this bead, and exist so a later refactor cannot quietly drop the guarantee.

  Which of them actually pins the atomic replace was measured, not assumed.
  Mutating ``dev``'s writer to an in-place ``O_TRUNC`` write leaves
  ``test_concurrent_writers_leave_one_complete_document`` green (5/5) and
  ``test_independent_processes_each_write_a_complete_document`` green (3/3) —
  both racing writers happen to produce a parseable document either way. The
  mutant is killed by ``test_failed_replace_retains_last_known_good`` and
  ``test_interrupted_write_retains_last_known_good``. Those two are the pin;
  cite them, not the concurrency pair.
* ``TestSerializedDurableWrite`` pins what this bead adds — a deterministic
  ``0600`` regardless of umask, a parent-directory fsync ordered AFTER the
  replace and unable to fail a save that already committed, writer
  serialization within and across processes on a bounded wait rather than an
  unbounded one, a lock file that cannot be turned into a chmod primitive or a
  permanent wedge, and removal of the credential-bearing temporaries a killed
  writer leaves behind.
