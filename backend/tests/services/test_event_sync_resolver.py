"""
Event sync resolver — shared preview/attach resolution layer
(bead enhancedchannelmanager-ti939.1.4).

``services.event_sync_resolver.resolve_event_sync`` is the ONE function the
Phase 1A preview endpoint calls and the Phase 1B attach path will call —
dry-run parity by construction. These tests pin:

* disposition classification (would_attach / ambiguous / unmatched /
  parse_failed) driven by the matcher's bands;
* determinism — identical inputs produce identical output, in a stable
  order, across repeated calls;
* per-group pattern routing (config.patterns / config.group_patterns,
  including a master-group override parsed with ITS patterns, not the
  secondary group's);
* unparsed-master surfacing (the master-as-ceiling diagnostic).

Pure module — no Dispatcharr client, no DB, no network.

    The exclusion set is consulted BEFORE the attach band is honored (step
    0 of ``_resolve_stream``): an excluded pairing can neither attach
    (threshold or accept-upgrade — exclusion OUTRANKS an accept for the
    same fingerprint) nor re-enqueue. A stream whose only viable pairing
    was excluded reports the distinct ``excluded_by_operator`` disposition;
    a stream with surviving candidates keeps their disposition and reports
    the suppression via ``excluded_suppressed`` / ``excluded_masters``.
    Fingerprints carry NO stream/channel ids, so churn survival is pinned
    by construction (and by test below).
