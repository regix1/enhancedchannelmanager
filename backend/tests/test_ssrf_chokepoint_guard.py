"""CI guard — forbid raw outbound calls in cloud_storage adapters.

Bead enhancedchannelmanager-0i2vt.5 / threat model §9.4 item 1 + §9.2 row B4:
the SSRF validator is only effective if it is the SINGLE chokepoint. An adapter
that opens its own HTTP connection (httpx / requests / urllib / aiohttp) or
constructs a boto3 client straight from an operator-supplied endpoint URL
bypasses the validator entirely — "SSRF protection is theatre."

This test is the build-failing guard. It does a lightweight AST scan of every
module under ``backend/cloud_storage/`` and FAILS if it finds a raw outbound
primitive that is not annotated as routed through the chokepoint.

How the guard is enforced
-------------------------
* It runs in the normal backend pytest suite (``.github/workflows/test.yml``
  → "Run pytest"), so any PR that re-introduces a raw outbound call in an
  adapter turns this test red and blocks the merge gate.
* An adapter that legitimately needs to make a call MUST route it through
  ``security.ssrf`` (the validated client / ``validate_outbound_url``). The
  scan ignores any module that imports ``security.ssrf`` AND tags the call
  site with a ``# ssrf-ok:`` comment giving the reason — see ``_ALLOW_TAG``.
  This keeps the guard honest: the escape hatch is explicit and greppable, not
  a silent default.

Why AST, not grep: a substring grep trips on strings, comments, and the word
"requests" in prose. The AST scan keys on actual ``import`` statements and
call expressions, so it has far fewer false positives while still being a hard
gate. A plain-text fallback covers ``# ssrf-ok:`` tagging.

NOTE: As of .5 the adapters are NOT yet migrated onto the chokepoint (that is
bead .8). Today's adapters DO contain raw calls. So this guard is written to
ASSERT THE CURRENT INVENTORY and FAIL if NEW untagged raw outbound primitives
appear beyond the known-baseline set. When .8 migrates an adapter, it removes
the baseline entry; when the baseline is empty the guard becomes a pure
"no raw outbound" gate. This makes the guard useful immediately (catches a new
bypass in a new adapter) without falsely failing on the pre-.8 baseline.
