"""Channel->group membership on a POPULATED target — reported, and reconciled on replace.

Beads ``enhancedchannelmanager-r1ei7`` (membership never reconciled, never
reported), ``enhancedchannelmanager-3t74w`` (a same-named but different channel
group is adopted while the report claims "already exists identical") and
``enhancedchannelmanager-tddmw`` (the preview omits the Streams category and
mispredicts channel_groups).

WHY NONE OF THIS WAS REACHABLE BEFORE. Every restore drill before run 12
(2026-08-07, ECM ``0.18.1-0040`` / Dispatcharr ``0.28.2``) restored onto a
freshly-wiped target, where every channel and every group is CREATED and the
destination has no opinion to disagree with. Run 12 restored the same artifact
onto a POPULATED, deliberately-diverged target and measured:

===================  ==============================  ==============================
archive              diverged target                 after restore (BOTH modes)
===================  ==============================  ==============================
Drill Sports  (376)  Drill Sports RENAMED (376)      unchanged; an empty second
  ch101-104            ch102-104, ch201-203          ``Drill Sports`` was created
Drill Movies  (377)  Drill Movies (379) — a          adopted by NAME, holding
  ch201-203            DIFFERENT object, ch101       ch101 the archive puts in
                                                     Drill Sports
Drill Empty   (378)  deleted                         recreated, empty
===================  ==============================  ==============================

Not one channel's group was corrected, in either relink mode, and the restore
reported ``outcome=success, failed 0``. The counts reconcile perfectly, which is
exactly the "counts reconciling is not proof" trap.

WHAT THIS SUITE PINS
--------------------
* ``preserve`` (the default) REPORTS every drifted channel and changes NOTHING —
  the "an existing channel is never overwritten" contract (spike ``xp6mp``) and
  the ``ChannelReattachMode`` default both continue to hold.
* ``overwrite`` reports the same set AND moves each channel into the archive's
  group.
* A channel group matched on NAME ONLY no longer claims
  ``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL``; it reports ``ALREADY_EXISTS_NAME_MATCH``. The
  adopt + FK remap itself is UNCHANGED — name is the only cross-instance identity
  a channel group carries (kxuj2 contract; ADR-008).
* Channel profiles and stream profiles, which share the same generic engine,
  still report ``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL``.
* A DRY RUN predicts the same drift the apply then reports (the ``dgnms``
  discipline), emits the ``Streams`` category it used to omit entirely, and says
  out loud that the ``channel_groups`` split it shows can differ from the apply's.
* DESELECTING the channel-groups category skips the check — and SAYS SO, in the
  report and in the task one-liner, rather than leaving a ``0`` that reads as a
  clean bill of health. That zero-means-two-things ambiguity is the same one
  ``predicted``/``caveat`` answer for a preview category; a skipped check gets
  the same answer for the same reason.

Conventions: ``docs/pytest_conventions.md``. Upstream is a stateful in-test fake
rather than a bare ``AsyncMock`` so the groups importer, the channels importer
and the reconcile pass observe ONE destination — the seam between them is the
thing under test, and a fixed-return mock would let each half agree with a
different instance.
