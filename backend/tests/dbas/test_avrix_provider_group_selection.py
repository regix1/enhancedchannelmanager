"""A replica must ingest the provider content its source ingests (…-avrix).

THE INVARIANT UNDER TEST, and the two-of-777 case is one EXAMPLE of it, not the
specification:

    A replica ingests the same provider content the source ingests, or the run
    says plainly that it will not.

WHAT WAS MEASURED, live, on Dispatcharr 0.29.0 against a real Xtream Codes
account on 2026-08-21 (bead ``…-kdz6p``'s acceptance environment):

* Source A: 777 ``dispatcharr_channels_channelgroupm3uaccount`` rows, exactly
  **2 enabled** — the choice that keeps the instance at 316 channels instead of
  the provider's 53,661 streams.
* Replica B after a sync whose every other counter was accurate: **0 rows**, and
  ``channel_group_drift`` reporting ``0`` throughout. Not wrong — silent. That
  counter measures which group a CHANNEL sits in, a different question.
* Given B's own credentials, B's refresh created all 777 rows from discovery and
  then logged ``Filtered 0 streams from 0 enabled categories`` and aborted:
  **0 streams where the source has 316.**
* The direction of the failure is not even stable. It is decided by
  ``auto_enable_new_groups_live``, which B faithfully inherits from A and which
  Dispatcharr's own serializer defaults to ``True``
  (``apps/m3u/serializers.py``: ``validated_data.pop(..., True)`` on create).
  With it ``True``, the SAME empty selection made B's discovery refresh enable
  **777 of 777** categories — the provider's entire catalogue.

Carrying the selection removes both outcomes, because the groups are then no
longer "new to this account" the first time the replica refreshes.

STRUCTURE USED (declared, per the sibling beads' convention): a top-level ``int``
on :class:`RestoreReport` (``provider_group_selection_unapplied``) plus a
dedicated ``provider_group_selection_details`` model list, mirroring the
``channel_group_drift`` / ``ChannelGroupDriftDetail`` pair. NOT
``skip_details``/``SkipReason`` — a dropped group selection is not a skipped
ENTITY, it is a partially-delivered field on an entity that was created — and
NOT ``failure_details``/``FailureReason``, because M3U_ACCOUNT is a FATAL
category and a group-settings write that did not land must not roll the whole
cycle back over an account that exists and is otherwise correct.

LAYERS. Tests 1-3 cross the real engine seam through ``SyncHarness`` (the
gather → ``run_sync`` → ``run_restore`` → the importers → B's stateful stores).
Tests 4-7 are unit-level over the apply helper and the summary renderer. Test 8
is the restore-path regression on the shared-helper refactor.
