"""Artifact-level regression tests for the drill's state-loss findings.

Beads ``enhancedchannelmanager-2o0cz`` / ``enhancedchannelmanager-dfkbn``. The
importer-level behaviour is pinned in ``test_restore_state_loss.py``; these tests
pin the two halves that live in the ARTIFACT itself, because an importer that
works perfectly restores nothing when the producer never wrote the bytes:

* the Dispatcharr LOGO INVENTORY is produced, so a remotely-hosted logo's URL
  survives the round trip (the drill's binary metadata was
  ``{"logo_count": 0, "logos": []}`` — ECM's own ``/config/uploads/logos/`` is
  empty because ECM's Logo Manager writes to DISPATCHARR's ``/data/logos/``);
* ECM's OWN ``categories/settings.yaml`` decodes into a restorable plan category
  (it was written by the builder from day one and dropped on the floor by the
  decoder, which is why ``user_timezone`` / ``stats_poll_interval`` reverted).
