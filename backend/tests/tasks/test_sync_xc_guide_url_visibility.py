"""A sync that strips an XC guide URL must not present as an unqualified success.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-v7d37`` (epic ``f5a5j``). Measured on Dispatcharr
0.29.0 by reading BOTH databases after an apply that reported
``success, created 134, failed 0``:

  A  'Northwind IPTV EPG (Xtream Codes)'  url=http://.../xmltv.php?username=...
  B  'Northwind IPTV EPG (Xtream Codes)'  url=<EMPTY>   status 'error', 'No URL provided'
  A  'Northwind Local XMLTV'              url=http://provider-northwind/local-epg.xml
  B  'Northwind Local XMLTV'              url=http://provider-northwind/local-epg.xml

53 of 59 channels landed on B with no EPG link; only the 6 Standard-M3U ones
kept theirs. The credential-free URL crossed intact and the credential-bearing
one did not, which is the mechanism rather than an inference.

AMENDED 2026-08-22 — THE XC GUIDE URL NOW CROSSES WHOLE
--------------------------------------------------------
ADR-013 amendment (b): the PO ruled that provider credentials cross on every
cycle, so an XC guide URL is carried with its credentials rather than stripped.
B's source therefore HAS an address, downloads its guide, and its channels keep
their EPG links — which is the measured 53-of-59 loss above, fixed at the source
rather than reported better.

**THE BUG THIS FILE EXISTS FOR IS THE SILENCE, NOT THE STRIPPING**, and that
half is untouched: when a source genuinely cannot deliver an address, the run's
ONE LINE must say so. That path is still live — an A restored from a standard
(redact-by-default) backup artifact holds a sentinelled url of its own, and the
artifact still redacts, because it is a file people attach to support tickets.
:func:`_source_with_sentinelled_guide` reaches that state and the reporting
assertions moved onto it, so the reporting coverage is preserved rather than
deleted along with the condition that used to produce it.

The layer-1 producer tests below are UNCHANGED: ``_scrub_credential_urls`` is
still exactly what the artifact path runs.

WHY THE URL IS STRIPPED WHOLE IN THE ARTIFACT, AND WHY THAT IS NOT THE BUG HERE.
For an Xtream Codes account the guide URL CONTAINS the credentials, so
``routers.backup._scrub_credential_urls`` cannot separate the secret from the
address and replaces the entire value with the redaction sentinel; the importer
then refuses to write the sentinel and leaves the field unset. Carrying a
partially-redacted address instead (shape (a) on the bead) is NOT attempted:
see the module docstring note in ``tasks/dbas_sync.py`` and the bead's report —
it is blocked on real-provider URL sampling, because an XC url whose PATH also
carries credentials would start leaking them the moment the whole-value rule
stopped applying.

THE BUG UNDER TEST IS THE SILENCE. The information already exists — the report
carries ``epg_links_unrestored`` and ``credential_reentry_details`` naming the
source and the ``url`` field — and the sync's one-line summary, the only surface
an unattended scheduled run ever produces, never mentioned either. The restore
path has named these action items since bead ``…-6pilh``/``…-dfkbn``
(``DbasRestoreTask._credential_reentry_suffix``); the SYNC path rendered only
the placeholder-stream clause, so everything else fell off the operator's line.

Four layers, because green at one proves nothing about the next:

1. **The producer** — which URL shape survives redaction and which does not.
2. **The destination** — what B actually STORES after a real apply: the EPG
   source's ``url`` and the channels' EPG links, read off B, not off the report.
3. **The operator's line** — the summary built from THAT report names both
   shortfalls. This is the assertion the broken code fails; it reported success.
4. **The TaskResult** — that line is what task history and the notification
   carry.
