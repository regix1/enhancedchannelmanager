"""Core settings reach the replica, per blob, with reasons (bead ``…-10wnq``).

THE INVARIANT UNDER TEST, quoted from the bead and stated as a property::

    Every category and column ADR-013 names is either implemented as named, or
    the ADR is amended to say what the code actually does and why. No item is
    left diverging silently.

``core_settings`` and ``insecure`` are TWO EXAMPLES of that property, not its
specification, so the tests below are parameterised over the register rather
than written against those two names.

WHAT WAS DIVERGING. ADR-013 S9 and S3 have listed "core settings" in the
per-cycle config set since the ADR was written. A grep for ``core_settings``
across the sync engine returned NOTHING — not in the category set, not in the
step registry, nowhere. Three of the seven blobs were additionally ruled SYNC by
the PO on 2026-08-21 and never built. Separately, S3's never-sync COLUMN list
named four columns while the shipped constant named three.

THE TRAP, named on the bead and pinned by test 2: settings are key/value BLOBS
and are deliberately absent from ``_SECTION_TO_ENTITY``, which maps sections to
ENTITY-LIST categories. The plan assembler iterates that table, so a category
key added on its own would have been INERT — wired-looking and moving nothing.

THE SILENT FK PROBLEM (tests 6-9), which the 2026-08-21 ruling did not account
for. Three of ``stream_settings``' five members are instance-local FK ids. Unlike
the M3U account's ``user_agent`` (bead ``…-9h6cv``) and ``server_group`` (bead
``…-g8tyd``), where B answered 400 and the defect announced itself, a settings
blob is a JSON value Dispatcharr stores without validating — so forwarding A's
ids points B's defaults at unrelated rows with no error, no counter and no
report.

MEASURED AGAINST ``dispatcharr:latest`` (0.29.0) on 2026-08-23, from the source
rather than from the live instance's values — the bead explicitly forbade
resolving ``user_limit_settings`` from its empty live case:

* ``core/models.py:426`` — ``stream_settings`` = ``default_user_agent``,
  ``default_stream_profile``, ``m3u_hash_key``, ``default_output_format``,
  ``hdhr_output_profile_id``.
* ``core/models.py:614`` — ``dvr_settings`` = path templates, comskip flags,
  offsets, ``series_rules``.
* ``core/models.py:701`` — ``proxy_settings`` = six plain numbers.
* ``core/models.py:714`` — ``network_access`` = per-endpoint CIDR allowlists.
* ``core/models.py:720`` — ``system_settings`` = timezone, event cap, region,
  three booleans.
* ``core/models.py:756`` — ``user_limit_settings`` = FOUR GLOBAL BOOLEANS, no
  user reference at any depth. Consumers: ``apps/proxy/utils.py:148-151,
  308-309, 358``.
* ``apps/backups/scheduler.py`` — ``backup_settings`` = schedule + retention.

    # NOTE, and it is a real distinction rather than a weakened assertion:
    # ``destination_unreadable`` is NOT set in this case, and must not be
    # asserted here. ``_ReadObservingClient`` builds its observing wrapper
    # inside ``__getattr__``, so a method that RAISES is caught and marked,
    # while a method that is ABSENT raises ``AttributeError`` out of
    # ``__getattr__`` itself, before any wrapper exists. Only the first is
    # reachable against a real ``DispatcharrClient``, which always has the
    # method — and that case is pinned by
    # ``test_a_settings_failure_does_not_delete_the_replica`` above, which does
    # assert the marker. This test covers the FIXTURE hazard; that one covers
    # the production one.
