"""A replica's M3U account tracks its source, field by field (bead ``…-zszjd``).

THE INVARIANT UNDER TEST, stated as a property. ``auto_enable_new_groups_live``
is ONE EXAMPLE of it and is deliberately not the specification::

    A field set on source A is the field set on replica B after the next sync
    cycle, for EVERY field on the M3U account, except those carrying a written
    exclusion in ``dbas.importers.m3u_accounts.NEVER_CONVERGE_FIELDS``.

WHAT WAS MEASURED, and why the flag is the wrong unit to test. During bead
``…-avrix``, ``auto_enable_new_groups_live`` was flipped on A (database only, no
refresh), a cycle was run, and B stayed on the old value — the account matched
``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL`` and was never written to. Spike ``xp6mp`` ruled
that skip, and the ruling covered the WHOLE ROW: ``server_url``,
``max_streams``, ``user_agent``, ``refresh_interval``, ``custom_properties``,
``username``, ``password``, ``account_type``, ``priority``,
``stale_stream_days``, ``is_active`` and the four preference booleans all froze
at their first-sync values. A fix scoped to the measured flag would have left
nineteen fields diverging exactly as silently. So the convergence test is
PARAMETERISED over the field surface, and the exclusion test is parameterised
over the exclusion register.

THE SECOND PROPERTY, which the defect's own worst feature demands. The bead's
finding is that the divergence was *silent*: "B stayed false … silently and
permanently, with nothing reporting the drift." So drift is REPORTED while it
exists — on the preview and on the apply — and the report CLEARS when the drift
does, which is what keeps it a signal rather than a permanent red mark.

LAYERS, declared. Tests 1-6 cross the real engine seam (``SyncHarness``: the
gather → ``run_sync`` → ``run_restore`` → the reused importers → B's stateful
stores), so they exercise the production path end to end rather than one helper.
Tests 7-10 are unit-level over ``build_convergence_patch`` and the report
recorder, where a per-field property is cheapest to state exhaustively.

FIXTURE FIDELITY. ``StatefulDispatcharrFake.patch_m3u_account`` models
Dispatcharr 0.29.0's ``M3UAccountSerializer.update`` — the four preference
booleans are popped into ``custom_properties`` and the blob is MERGED rather
than replaced — because both behaviours decide whether these assertions can fail
at all. A fake that stored the booleans at the top level would contradict its own
``get_m3u_accounts``, which projects them back out of the blob.
