"""Migration tests for ``pending_merges`` + ``pending_merge_journal`` (revision 0014).

Bead: ``enhancedchannelmanager-6by2n`` (BD-C of the v0.17.1 interactive
stream dedup epic, ADR-008 §D8).

Covers:

* Fresh up from 0013 → both tables present with all seven indexes and both
  named CHECK constraints (status + action_type).
* Fresh down from 0014 → both tables and all seven indexes gone.
* bd-5w6jz idempotency: re-run the migration on a DB where one or both
  tables have already been materialised by ``create_all()`` from the
  post-0014 ORM model (long-running install scenario). Each CREATE TABLE
  / CREATE INDEX is independently guarded so any subset of pre-existing
  artifacts is safe to re-encounter.
* CHECK enforcement: a direct INSERT with ``status='bogus'`` on
  ``pending_merges`` or with ``action_type='not_an_action'`` on
  ``pending_merge_journal`` raises ``IntegrityError``.
* §D5 partial-unique invariant: two ``pending`` rows with the same
  ``(stream_name, candidate_channel_id)`` pair → second raises
  IntegrityError. A ``merged`` + ``pending`` pair on the same key → both
  succeed (the partial WHERE clause excludes ``merged`` from the
  uniqueness scope).
* FK enforcement on ``pending_merge_journal.pending_merge_id`` → insert
  with a non-existent FK target raises ``IntegrityError`` when SQLite FK
  enforcement is on. The connect listener in ``database.py`` sets
  ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`` on every connect, so the test environment
  matches production. A debug-only ``sqlite3`` CLI session would
  silently insert (FK is declarative without the PRAGMA) — that
  divergence is documented in the migration docstring's PRAGMA caveat.

ADR deviation note (carried verbatim from the migration docstring):
``trigger_context`` is app-validated at write time rather than CHECK-ed
at the DB layer. ADR-008 §D8 originally specified
``CHECK in ('drag_drop','add_stream','m3u_refresh','mcp_tool')`` for both
tables; the PO's BD-C implementation brief downgraded both to
app-validated enums so future surface additions do not force a schema
migration. The four canonical tags remain unchanged.

All fixtures use synthetic identities — no production-derived channel
UUIDs or token strings.
