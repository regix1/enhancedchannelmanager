"""
Event-loop responsiveness integration tests (bd-w3z4h).

Before this bead, sync CPU-heavy code (normalization_engine.normalize,
dummy_epg_engine.generate_xmltv, etc.) was called directly inside async
FastAPI handlers, which blocks the single-worker event loop for every
concurrent request.

These tests assert the fix: /api/health stays responsive (<500ms) while a
pathological sync CPU load is in flight at another endpoint. They use the
full ASGI app + async test client, so they exercise the real middleware
stack and dependency graph.
