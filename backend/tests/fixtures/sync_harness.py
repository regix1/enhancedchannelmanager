"""Stateful two-instance (source-A → dest-B) cross-instance sync TEST HARNESS.

Bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-46pkq`` (epic ``i39wu``). This is the reusable,
shareable harness the convergence / idempotency / partial-failure keystone tests
rest on (``tests/tasks/test_sync_roundtrip.py``), the sync-test analogue of the
DBAS restore round-trip anchor (``tests/dbas/test_restore_roundtrip.py``).

What problem this solves
------------------------
The pre-existing sync engine tests (``test_dbas_sync_engine.py``) mock dest-B as a
bag of independent ``AsyncMock`` create/get methods and then assert on **call
counts** (``create_m3u_account.assert_awaited()``). That proves the engine *calls*
B, but it cannot prove B *converged*: a stateless mock's ``get_*`` always returns
the same canned list regardless of what was just created, so a second ``run_sync``
re-creates everything and "idempotency" can only be asserted against a *different*
hand-built "already converged" mock — not against the real apply.

This harness instead models **B as a real instance**: a :class:`StatefulDispatcharrFake`
that APPLIES the writes it receives. ``create_*`` stores the entity and returns it
with a NEW server-assigned id; a duplicate ``create_*`` (same natural key) raises a
**409 conflict** exactly like Dispatcharr; ``update_*`` mutates the stored row;
``delete_*`` (the rollback compensator) removes it (404 when already gone). That
statefulness is what makes the assertions REAL:

* **Convergence** — after ``run_sync(confirm_apply=True)`` against an empty B you
  can assert ``B.state() == A.state()`` *by natural key*, not by call count.
* **Idempotency** — a SECOND ``run_sync`` against the SAME (now-populated) B is a
  genuine no-op: B's own ``get_*`` now returns what was created, so the importers
  match → ``ALREADY_EXISTS_IDENTICAL`` and zero creates fire. No second mock.
* **Partial failure** — inject a mid-sync write error on B; because B actually
  stored the earlier creates, you can assert the rollback compensated them and B
  is left consistent, then that a clean re-run converges.

Write-API contract fidelity (the bead's least-validated surface)
----------------------------------------------------------------
The dest-B fake models the Dispatcharr WRITE contract the sync path depends on,
captured as fixtures here because no live Dispatcharr-B is reachable in this
environment (see ``docs/testing/dbas-test-env.md`` → cross-instance section):

* ``create_*`` returns the created object echoing the payload PLUS a NEW
  server-assigned ``id`` (B assigns ids; A's ids are never reused on B).
* a DUPLICATE ``create_*`` (same natural key already present) surfaces a **409
  conflict** — :class:`FakeConflictError`, a ``httpx.HTTPStatusError`` carrying a
  real 409 ``Response`` so the importers' status classifiers (which call
  ``raise_for_status`` semantics / parse ``"<thing> failed: <status> - <body>"``)
  treat it correctly.
* ``update_*`` mutates the stored row in place and returns it.
* ``delete_*`` removes the row; deleting an absent id raises a 404
  (:class:`FakeNotFoundError`) — the orchestrator's ``404-as-success`` rollback
  path depends on this shape.
* ``create_channel_group`` takes a NAME STRING (Dispatcharr's quirk); every other
  ``create_*`` takes a payload DICT — mirrored faithfully so the REUSED importers
  run unchanged.

        MODELS ``M3UAccountSerializer.update``, read off Dispatcharr 0.29.0 on
        2026-08-23, because two of its behaviours decide whether a convergence
        test can fail at all:

        * **The four preference booleans are POPPED off the top level and written
          into ``custom_properties``** — the same asymmetry ``create`` has (see
          ``_PREFERENCE_DEFAULTS``). A fake that stored them at the top level
          would be contradicted by ``get_m3u_accounts``, which projects them
          back OUT of the blob, so the round trip has to go through the blob or
          the value never survives a read.
        * **``custom_properties`` is MERGED, not replaced**:
          ``custom_props = {**existing_custom, **incoming_custom}``. A key the
          destination holds and the source does not therefore SURVIVES a PATCH.
          That is the honest ceiling on convergence through this endpoint, and
          modelling replacement instead would let a test assert a deletion the
          real API cannot perform.

        Unlike ``update`` the booleans are only written when PRESENT — a partial
        PATCH that omits them must not reset them to the create-time defaults.
