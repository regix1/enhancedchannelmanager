    MCP integration's ``mcp_api_key`` field; operators rotating the MCP key
    were copying the new MCP key into ``api_key`` (since the UI labels the
    Dispatcharr token "API Key"), which caused ECM to send the MCP key to
    Dispatcharr and break every channel/stream operation with 401.

      - If ``dispatcharr_api_key`` is already populated → no-op (idempotent).

        pointing the operator at the rename.
      - If both are populated and disagree → ``dispatcharr_api_key`` wins
        (the legacy field is treated as stale).
