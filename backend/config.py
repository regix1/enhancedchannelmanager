# The fallback is ``CONFIG_DIR``, NOT "no projection". That is deliberate: a

# ``<CONFIG_DIR>/mcp-service.json``, overlay or not — both 0600 and owned by
# ECM. Operators who bind-mount a host directory at ``/config`` should know
# that ``api-key`` is a credential file sitting at its top level; see

# with ``LOCK_NB`` on a bounded retry budget, so two savers in ONE process
# would burn that budget against each other and one could time out on an
# otherwise idle host; the RLock turns intra-process contention into an

    * A path is REJECTED rather than stripped. ECM's frontend is built with
      Vite's default ``base`` of ``/`` and its router serves ``/reset-password``

      of them can be meaningful in an origin, and userinfo in particular is a
      classic way to make a link's real destination hard to read.

    """Migrate legacy ``api_key`` field to ``dispatcharr_api_key`` (bd-jmi1c, GH #273).

    Until v0.17.1, the Dispatcharr REST API token was stored in
    ``settings.json:api_key``. That field name collides lexically with the
    MCP integration's ``mcp_api_key`` field; operators rotating the MCP key
    were copying the new MCP key into ``api_key`` (since the UI labels the
    Dispatcharr token "API Key"), which caused ECM to send the MCP key to
    Dispatcharr and break every channel/stream operation with 401.

    The canonical field is now ``dispatcharr_api_key``. This migration runs
    on every settings load so existing operators don't have to touch their
    config files:

      - If ``dispatcharr_api_key`` is already populated → no-op (idempotent).
      - If only legacy ``api_key`` is populated → copy into
        ``dispatcharr_api_key`` and emit ONE WARN per process startup
        pointing the operator at the rename.
      - If both are populated and disagree → ``dispatcharr_api_key`` wins
        (the legacy field is treated as stale).

    The legacy ``api_key`` field is *not* deleted from the in-memory dict
    or from settings.json — external tools that read the file directly
    (the workaround in GH #273's issue body, ad-hoc operator scripts) keep
    working. ``save_settings()`` also mirrors the canonical value back into
