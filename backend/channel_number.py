"""Canonical channel-number contract for ECM (bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-ic884.1``).

A channel number is a **non-negative number with at most one decimal place**.
That is the PO's rule, recorded on bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-ic884.1``:
Dispatcharr's channel-number precision is one significant digit, so only the
tenths place carries meaning.

``None`` means "unassigned" and is always allowed; a channel with no number is a
normal state in Dispatcharr.

What the contract deliberately does NOT say:

* **No uniqueness.** Dispatcharr declares ``channel_number`` as a non-unique
  float and its release notes state duplicates are permitted. Real lineups have
  them. Uniqueness is a separate question and is not enforced here.
* **No maximum among floats.** The PO's rule named none, and Dispatcharr stores
  a plain float, so inventing an upper bound here would narrow compatibility. An
  absurd-but-finite value such as ``1e308`` is therefore in contract: it is an
  exact integer (every float at or above ``2**53`` is), so it carries no
  fractional part. It is answered, not raised on. ``inf`` and ``nan`` are not
  finite and are rejected.

There is one limit, and it is about representability rather than magnitude.
Python ``int`` is arbitrary precision, so a JSON body can carry a value such as
``10**400`` that has no ``float`` representation at all. Those are **rejected**.
A channel number has to survive the round trip this contract spans: JSON number
to a JavaScript ``number`` in the browser, and to Dispatcharr's plain float
column. ``10**400`` survives neither -- the frontend parses it to ``Infinity``
and rejects it as non-finite, and there is no float to store. Accepting it in
Python on the grounds that an ``int`` has no fractional part would leave the two
halves disagreeing about an input either side can be handed, while their
docstrings claim an identical rule. So the predicate answers ``False`` rather
than raising ``OverflowError`` out of ``float()``.

Out-of-contract values are **rejected at the boundary**, not silently rounded.
That is an explicit PO choice: an import that previously succeeded may now fail,
on the grounds that surfacing bad data beats silently altering it.

Every backend entry point that accepts a channel number consumes this module
rather than re-implementing a check. The frontend mirror is
``frontend/src/utils/channelNumber.ts`` and carries the identical message text.

Tests: ``backend/tests/unit/test_channel_number.py``.

#
# * Reject side. The nearest out-of-contract value to a tenth is half a tick
#   away, which is 0.5 once scaled -- a margin of 5e8 over the tolerance, so
#   `1.05` can never slip through. Measured: `10**n + 0.05` scales to a
#   deviation of exactly 0.5 and is rejected for every n from 0 to 14. That
#   discrimination holds up to `2**48`. At `2**49` float spacing is 0.125, which
#   exceeds the 0.05 half-tick, so `base + 0.05` is not a distinct float and
#   there is no two-decimal value left to reject.
# * Accept side. The tolerance is not what makes ordinary numbers pass. For
#   every one-decimal value `k / 10` below `_EXACT_INTEGER_FLOOR`, scaling back
#   by ten returns `k` exactly: measured deviation 0.0 over 3.4M sampled values
#   across all seventeen decades, plus exhaustively over 0.0-200.0. Parsed input
#   (`float("10000000.1")`) and planned input (`channelNumberShift.ts` divides
#   integer ticks by ten once, at the end) are both drawn from that population.
# * Dust. The tolerance therefore earns its keep on one case only: arithmetic
#   drift, such as `0.7 + 0.1` being `0.7999999999999999`. Being absolute, the
#   dust it absorbs shrinks with magnitude -- about 4.5e5 float steps at
#   magnitude 1, about 7 at 1e5, and less than one above roughly 1e6. Above that
#   the predicate accepts only values that round-trip exactly, which is what the
#   two producers above deliver. A magnitude-relative tolerance was measured as
#   the alternative and is worse where it matters: at 8 float steps it accepts
#   `1e14 + 0.05`, which is a real two-decimal value that must be rejected.

# safe: the largest value that reaches it is just under `2**53`, and

    One tick per tenth. Ticks exist so that comparing and stepping channel
    numbers can be exact: ``1.1 + 0.1`` is ``1.2000000000000002``, but tick 11
    plus tick 1 is tick 12, and tick 12 divides back to exactly ``1.2``. Any
    caller walking the grid does its arithmetic here and divides back once, at
    the end, via :func:`channel_number_from_ticks`. That is the same discipline
    ``frontend/src/utils/channelNumberShift.ts`` follows, on the same grid.

    Below ``2**49`` in-contract numbers map one-to-one onto ticks, so on
    contract-clean data a tick comparison IS equality rather than an
    approximation of it. That bound is where floats run out of room, not an
    arbitrary cutoff: adjacent floats from there up are 0.125 apart, which is
    wider than a tenth, so several ticks share one float and the mapping stops
    being injective. Whole numbers are exempt at every magnitude, because the
    ``int`` branch below never touches a float. :func:`channel_number_from_ticks`
    carries the measurements and the matching caveat on the inverse.

    There is no
    ECM column for ``channel_number``: the numbers come from Dispatcharr, which
    enforces neither precision nor uniqueness, so a value written before this
    contract landed or by another client can still be out of contract. Such a
    value collapses onto the nearest tenth, matching the deliberate collapse the
    frontend planner makes for the same reason. Collapsing is the conservative
    direction: the number is read as occupying the slot an operator sees it in,
    never as leaving that slot free. Which way an exact half collapses is left
    to :func:`round`, because nothing depends on it; the frontend's
    ``Math.round`` breaks that one tie upward instead.

    Args:
        value: A finite number. Negatives are permitted so that a lineup this
            module did not write can still be read; the contract itself excludes
            them, and :func:`is_valid_channel_number` is where that is decided.

    Returns:
        The tick index. Exact for every value the contract can hold. Distinct

        whole numbers.

    The counterpart to :func:`channel_number_ticks`. Divide back exactly once,
    at the end of whatever walk produced the tick, which is what keeps the
    result on the grid instead of accumulating drift.

    How far the inverse actually holds, measured against this implementation:

    * **A whole tick, at every magnitude.** It divides back to a Python ``int``
      with no float in the path, and :func:`channel_number_ticks` multiplies
      that ``int`` straight back. ``10**401`` round-trips as readily as ``10``.
    * **A tenth, only below ``2**49``.** Adjacent floats below that bound are at
      most 0.0625 apart, narrower than a tenth, so distinct tenths keep distinct
      floats and rounding recovers the tick (measured: zero failures over the
      5000 ticks below the bound, and over every tick to 2000). From ``2**49``
      up the gap is 0.125, wider than a tenth, so a run of ticks divides back to
      one shared float and that float reports only one of their tick values.
      1000 of the first 5000 ticks at the bound fail the round trip.

    A caller walking the grid must therefore treat a tick whose number does not
    map back to it as unusable rather than as its own slot: two ticks that share
    a float are the same channel number, so one of them being free proves
    nothing about the other. ``ActionExecutor._next_free_number_from_ticks`` in
    backend/channel_pipeline_executor.py is the one such walk, and it drops to
    whole numbers at that point. Tests:
    ``backend/tests/unit/test_channel_number.py``.

    Returns:
        An ``int`` when the tick lands on a whole number, a ``float`` when it
        carries a tenth. The narrowing is deliberate: these values are
        serialised straight into JSON bodies and into channel names, where
        ``800.0`` reads as a change and ``800`` does not. It also keeps a whole
