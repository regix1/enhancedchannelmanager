/**
 * Survival store for Edit Mode's staged ledger across a dead session
 * (epic enhancedchannelmanager-r93hq).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. Edit Mode stages changes until Apply All. Navigation,
 * browser Back/Forward and Sign Out all run through the exit guard now, so
 * staged work cannot be discarded silently by any of them. One path is left
 * and it cannot be guarded, because the app is not what is leaving — the
 * SESSION is. A refresh fails, or /me answers 401/403, `useAuth` clears the
 * user, `ProtectedRoute` swaps the app for `<LoginPage />`, and the ledger,
 * which lives only in `useEditMode`'s React state, dies with it. Apply is not
 * available at that moment either: the session is already gone, so every
 * commit call would 401.
 *
 * FOUR PROPERTIES, IN THE ORDER THEY MATTER.
 *
 * 1. THE LEDGER IS BOUND TO THE OPERATOR WHO STAGED IT. "Signing back in on
 *    the same tab" is not "the same person". A ledger stamped with a different
 *    operator key is not withheld, it is DESTROYED — leaving one operator's
 *    staged channel edits reachable in a shared workstation's tab is the risk
 *    itself, because the next operator would Apply them under their own
 *    credentials and the journal would attribute every change to them.
 *
 * 2. IT LIVES IN `sessionStorage`. The ledger dies with the tab rather than
 *    sitting on disk indefinitely. {@link STAGED_LEDGER_MAX_AGE_MS} bounds the
 *    remaining case — a tab left open across a suspend.
 *
 * 3. IT IS VALIDATED BEFORE IT IS RESTORED, NEVER AFTER. Staged operations
 *    name channel ids, group ids, stream ids and this session's own temp ids.
 *    Any of them can have moved while the session was dead. Restoring blindly
 *    and applying against wrong ids is far worse than losing the work, so
 *    {@link planLedgerRestore} answers with BOTH halves — what can be restored
 *    and what cannot, with a reason per operation. A partial restore the
 *    operator can read is fine; a silent one is not.
 *
 * 4. A CONFIRMATION IS CHECKED AGAINST THE LINEUP IT DESCRIBED, not merely
 *    carried. The operator who confirmed "102 is used by Bravo — use it
 *    anyway?" consented to sharing 102 WITH BRAVO. If Bravo moved off 102 and
 *    Delta moved on while the session was dead, that is a collision nobody was
 *    ever shown, so {@link planLedgerRestore} withdraws the confirmation and
 *    reports it. The EDIT still comes back — losing the operator's work over a
 *    stale confirmation would be a worse trade — but the final-state preflight
 *    asks again before Apply.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CHECKED, so the gaps are decisions and not
 * accidents: a stream id being ATTACHED by `addStreamToChannel` (the channel
 * list carries stream ids, not a stream inventory, so a vanished stream is
 * only visible at commit time, where the backend reports it); a hidden group
 * id in `restoreChannelGroup` (hidden groups are by definition absent from the
 * visible group list, so checking there would drop every restore); and profile
 * ids when the caller does not supply {@link LedgerRestoreContext.profileIds}.

 *  assignments were lost, so it is discarded rather than guessed at.
 *
 *  2: a duplicate-number confirmation became `acknowledgedDuplicate`, an
 *  object carrying the occupants alongside the number, replacing the bare
