/**
 * Channel-number push-down planner (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-i85dg`).
 *
 * Inserting channels at an occupied number has to move the channels already
 * sitting there. Two call sites used to plan that move independently, and both
 * planned it wrong:
 *
 *   - `App.tsx` `handleBulkCreateFromGroup` modelled each channel group as one
 *     continuous `[minNum, maxNum]` interval and cascaded into the next group
 *     whenever `maxNum + shiftAmount` reached that group's `minNum`. A single
 *     outlier high number anywhere in the target group inflated `maxNum` past
 *     every downstream group's minimum, so the cascade swept the whole lineup.
 *     The same interval model also skipped groups whose `minNum` sorted before
 *     the target group but whose `maxNum` overlapped its tail, which created
 *     duplicates.
 *   - `ChannelsPane.tsx` `handleCrossGroupMoveConfirm` shifted every target
 *     group channel at or after the insertion point with no cascade at all, so
 *     the target group's tail was pushed silently onto the next group's
 *     numbers.
 *
 * Neither model is repairable: nothing in ECM, Dispatcharr's API contract or
 * the database constrains `channel_number` by `channel_group_id`. Groups are
 * free to contain holes and outliers, to overlap, and to interleave, and
 * `channel_number` is a non-unique float, so duplicates exist in real lineups.
 *
 * This planner therefore never asks which group a number belongs to. Group
 * membership decides the operator's INTENT (which channels are being inserted,
 * and where); it is not an input to the arithmetic. The rule is pure occupancy:
 *
 *   Given the occupied channel numbers of the working copy, an insertion point
 *   `s`, a count `n` and a spacing `step`, the new channels take the INSERTION
 *   LATTICE points `s, s + step, ..., s + (n-1) * step`. Shift every channel
 *   occupying a number from `s` up to (not including) a stop point, each by
 *   `shift = n * step`, choosing the smallest stop that collides with nothing.
 *   Every occupant of a number moves, so pre-existing duplicates stay together
 *   instead of being split apart.
 *
 * What "collides with nothing" means, precisely, because this is where the
 * first version of this planner was wrong. The plan CLAIMS exactly two sets of
 * numbers: the lattice points the new channels take, and the number each
 * shifted channel lands on (`t + shift` for every occupied `t` in `[s, stop)`).
 * A stop is valid when no claimed number is still held by a channel that did
 * not move: that is, by an occupant at or above `stop`. Nothing else can
 * clash: a shifted channel lands at or above `s + shift`, which is above every
 * lattice point the new channels take, and the shift is order-preserving and
 * injective, so shifted channels cannot land on each other.
 *
 * The first version instead required an entire `shift`-wide CONTINUOUS
 * interval to be free. That conflates the lattice with the interval it spans.
 * Inserting one channel at 300 claims the single number 300; it does not claim
 * `[300.0, 300.9]`. With only `300.5` in the lineup, the interval test
 * moved it to `301.5` although the insertion slot 300 was free; with `300` and
 * `300.5`, it moved both although moving `300 -> 301` was already enough. The
 * two rules coincide for whole numbers on a whole-number step, which is why a
 * suite of integer fixtures could not tell them apart.
 *
 * Choosing the SMALLEST valid stop is what makes the plan minimal. Note that
 * minimality is over the family "shift the contiguous RUN `[s, stop)`", which
 * is the rule the operator was given ("the shift propagates only as far as it
 * must, and terminates at the first free number"). A channel sitting off the
 * lattice INSIDE that run moves with it (`300.5` moves when `300` and `301`
 * both move) because leaving it behind would put it below the channel that
 * was at 300, reversing two channels the operator never asked to reorder.
 *
 * All planning is done in integer ticks, one tick per tenth. The previous
 * implementation compared an unrounded running maximum against group minimums,
 * so `0.7 + 0.1` compared below `0.8` and invented a gap, while other
 * combinations compared above an exact boundary and invented a cascade. Float
 * drift was a cause of both a wrong stop and a wrong cascade, not merely untidy
 * output. Ticks remove the comparison entirely; the division back to channel
 * numbers happens once, at the end.
 *
 * Tests: `channelNumberShift.test.ts`.

/**
 * Comparisons are made on a fixed integer grid so that every one of them is
 * exact. The grid is TENTHS, because that is Dispatcharr's channel-number
 * resolution: a channel number carries at most one decimal place, and ECM's
 * decimal insert steps by exactly `0.1`. Grid resolution and data contract
 * therefore coincide, and for any number the system can actually hold the
 * number-to-tick mapping is one-to-one. No two distinct valid channel numbers
 * share a tick, and no valid free number can be read as taken, so on
 * in-contract data the tick comparison IS exact equality; the grid is not an
 * approximation of it.
 *
 * That contract is now enforced on the way in. `frontend/src/utils/
 * channelNumber.ts` and `backend/channel_number.py` define the domain, and
 * every channel-number entry point rejects an out-of-contract value like
 * `1.05` rather than rounding it (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-ic884.1`).
 * There is still no ECM column for `channel_number` at all, so the lineup this
 * planner reads comes from Dispatcharr, which enforces nothing itself: a value
 * written before enforcement landed, or by any other Dispatcharr client, can
 * still be out of contract. This module's handling of that case is therefore
 * DEFENSIVE rather than load-bearing, and unchanged: such a value collapses
 * onto the nearest tenth for COMPARISON, and lands on the tenths grid on
 * OUTPUT (see the `toNumber` computation below). Both are deliberate:
 *
 *   - Collapsing for comparison is conservative. An out-of-contract number is
 *     treated as occupying the slot an operator reads it as, so the planner
 *     can only move a channel it might have left alone; it can never leave one
 *     sitting on a number the insert was supposed to free.
 *   - Snapping on output returns a number the contract can represent. Emitting
 *     `2.05` instead would carry the out-of-contract value forward into a
 *     value Dispatcharr cannot hold at that precision.
 *
 * This module does NOT enforce the invariant; it only has to cope with
 * whatever is already in the lineup. Defining and enforcing the canonical
 * channel-number domain is the job of `channelNumber.ts` and its backend
 * counterpart. The collapse is pinned by the "collapses an out-of-contract
 * number onto the nearest tenth" test in `channelNumberShift.test.ts`; it is a
 * pinned behaviour, not an enforced guarantee about the data.
