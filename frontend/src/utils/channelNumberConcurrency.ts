/**
 * Whether the numbers this session is about to write are still the numbers it
 * was looking at (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-ic884.4`).
 *
 * WHAT THE UPSTREAM API MAKES POSSIBLE, measured rather than assumed. The live
 * Dispatcharr 0.28.x schema (`GET /api/schema/?format=json`, HTTP 200, ~717KB,
 * fetched 2026-08-15) contains ZERO occurrences of `If-Match`, `If-None-Match`,
 * `If-Unmodified-Since`, `ETag` or `412`, and neither `Channel` nor
 * `PatchedChannel` carries a version or modified-at field. There is no
 * conditional update and no revision token, so nothing here can PREVENT a
 * concurrent overwrite. What it can do is READ the current state, compare it
 * against the state the session was staged on, and refuse to write over a
 * difference the operator has not seen. A change that lands between that read
 * and the write is still lost, and no wording in this module says otherwise.
 *
 * THE BASELINE is the channel list as it stood when the session began —
 * `EditModeState.baselineSnapshot`, captured by `enterEditMode` and RE-captured
 * by `restoreStagedLedger`, so a session rebuilt from `sessionStorage` compares
 * against today's lineup and never against the one its dead predecessor saw.
 * The persisted ledger deliberately does not carry a baseline: a stored
 * baseline would be exactly the stale value the whole check exists to catch.
 *
 * A RECONCILE DECISION IS BOUND TO THE CONFLICT IT RESOLVED, the same way a
 * duplicate acknowledgement is bound to the collision it consented to (bead
 * `enhancedchannelmanager-vdxbx`). "Keep mine" is consent to overwrite ONE
 * observed change — this channel, this baseline value, this server value — and
 * it rides on the staged operation rather than in a registry beside it, so
 * undoing the operation withdraws the decision, a restored ledger carries it,
 * and a server value that moves AGAIN before Apply makes the decision stop
 * matching and the conflict is raised once more.
 *
 * Comparison is the canonical one `channelNumberPlan.ts` defines, so `7` and
 * `7.0` are one number and `7.1` is a different one.
 *
 * Tests: `channelNumberConcurrency.test.ts`.
