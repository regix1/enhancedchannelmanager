/**
 * Push-down planner properties (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-i85dg`).
 *
 * The shift logic had shipped three times with no test at all, and came back
 * a fourth time. Every property below is written against the PO's stated rule
 * rather than against the implementation, and properties 2 to 5, 7 and 10 were
 * each demonstrated failing against a verbatim port of the replaced
 * `App.tsx` interval algorithm before this planner existed.
 *
 * Numbering matches the brief so a future reader can map a regression back to
 * the behaviour it broke.
 *
 * A Codex pre-merge review then found that the first planner treated a whole
 * `step`-wide continuous interval as claimed rather than the lattice points
 * the new channels actually take, and that THIS FILE could not catch it: the
 * reference implementation below encoded the same assumption, and the
 * randomised generator emitted whole numbers only, for which the two readings
 * are identical. Both were rewritten from the rule. The reference decides
 * validity by applying a candidate plan and looking for collisions, and the
 * generator now emits decimals, off-lattice numbers and mixed lineups. No
 * expectation in the properties above changed, because none of their fixtures
 * could distinguish the two rules; the gap was coverage, not wrong answers.
 *
 * The PO then supplied the data contract the planner had been guessing at:
 * decimal precision in Dispatcharr is one significant digit, so a channel
 * number carries at most one decimal place. The planner's grid moved to
 * tenths to match it, which retired a whole class of fixtures: values
 * differing only past the third decimal, which the planner had been treating
 * as distinct valid inputs. They are not valid inputs, so the tests that
 * pinned behaviour for them are gone, and the generator now emits numbers on
 * the tenths grid, which is what real data looks like. One out-of-contract
 * case is kept and pinned, because `backend/csv_handler.py` still accepts any
 * positive float; see "collapses an out-of-contract number onto the nearest
 * tenth" below.

 *
 * `SCALE` above is 1000, deliberately 100x finer than the planner's own
 * tenths grid, so this reference does not inherit the planner's choice of
 * resolution. Every number the contract allows lands on a tenth, so the two
 * grids must agree exactly on in-contract data, which is why the property
 * tests below assert equality against this reference rather than a one-sided
 * bound. A planner whose grid was too coarse for the contract would disagree
 * here.
 *
 * The rule, restated so this reference does not inherit the planner's
 * reasoning: `count` channels inserted at `startingNumber` with spacing `step`
 * take the LATTICE POINTS `startingNumber + k * step` for `k < count`. They do
 * not occupy the continuous interval spanned by those points, so a number
 * sitting between two of them is not in the way. Shifting the run of channels
 * occupying `[startingNumber, stop)` up by `count * step` is collision-free
 * exactly when nothing the plan CLAIMS (those lattice points, plus the number
 * each shifted channel lands on) is still held by a channel that stayed put.
 *
 * So: try each candidate stop in ascending order, build the claimed and
 * stayed-put sets the long way, and return the first stop where they are
 * disjoint. The plan depends on `stop` only through which occupied ticks fall
 * below it, so `startingNumber` and one tick past each occupied number are the
 * only values that can ever be the smallest valid stop.
 *
 * Returns the raw stop in ticks, not the lattice-rounded `stopNumber` the
 * planner reports, so nothing about the planner's rounding leaks in here.
