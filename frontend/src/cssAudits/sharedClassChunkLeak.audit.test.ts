/**
 * Regression guard for the cross-chunk shared-class leak.
 *
 * THE DEFECT (repaired five times, recurred five times: `.list-header`
 * (bead qlc4h), `.status-label` (f4yc7), `.group-count` (sccol),
 * `.action-btn .material-icons`, and `.action-btn`'s box geometry):
 *
 *   A page CSS file redeclares a class that `shared/common.css` already
 *   owns, with no ancestor scoping, at equal specificity. Every route tab
 *   is a lazily-imported chunk whose stylesheet is appended to <head> on
 *   first visit and NEVER removed. `common.css` is emitted last inside the
 *   EAGER bundle (byte 263,255 of 263,419), so it beats every other eager
 *   file — but it loses permanently to any bare rule in any tab chunk the
 *   user has visited. The winner therefore depends on which tabs were
 *   visited and in what order, which is why the bug reappears as "the icons
 *   are the wrong size but only sometimes".
 *
 * WHAT THIS CHECKS: the same normalised selector, under the same at-rule
 * context, declaring a property this guard covers, in TWO DIFFERENT CHUNKS.
 *
 * "Bare" is operationalised as "identical selector text". That is exact for
 * this defect class and needs no hardcoded list of page-scope roots:
 *   - `.action-btn` in common.css vs `.action-btn` in LogoManagerTab.css
 *     -> identical text, different chunks -> FAIL (the real bug).
 *   - `.action-btn` in common.css vs `.logo-manager-tab .action-btn`
 *     -> different text AND higher specificity -> pass (correctly scoped).
 * It also catches descendant selectors like `.action-btn .material-icons`,
 * which a naive "selector contains no combinator" rule would miss — that
 * was instance #4.
 *
 * This property — that scoping a rule makes it a different key, and
 * therefore invisible to the check — is why covering a high-traffic
 * property like `display` costs almost nothing in false positives. Every
 * page-scoped `display` in the tree is already a distinct selector.
 *
 * CHUNK MEMBERSHIP IS DERIVED, NEVER HARDCODED, so a page added next year is
 * covered automatically. See `deriveChunks()` for the model and the
 * tradeoff against reading the built output.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THREE TIERS, TWO AXES — deliberate, see beads enhancedchannelmanager-6z299.6
 * (tiers 1-2) and enhancedchannelmanager-mklhu (tier 3)
 *
 * TIER 1 (typography): unbaselined. Every violation is reported. It is RED on
 * purpose while the P1 type-scale consolidation burns it down, and its count
 * is the metric that sweep is tracked against. Do not baseline it, do not
 * add exceptions to it, do not narrow its property list.
 *
 * TIER 2 (layout + visual): baselined against `KNOWN_CROSS_CHUNK_LAYOUT`
 * below. This tier was added after tier 1 and found 49 pre-existing
 * collisions that no wave of the consolidation owns end-to-end. Reporting all
 * 49 as a second permanent failure would have added no regression signal —
 * a check that is always red cannot tell you that a 50th appeared. So the 49
 * are recorded explicitly, with the bead that retires each, and the assertion
 * fails on:
 *   - any collision NOT in the baseline           (a new leak — the point)
 *   - any baseline entry whose collision is GONE  (stale — delete the line)
 *   - any baseline entry whose CHUNK SET moved    (partly fixed, or spread)
 * so the list cannot rot and cannot silently grow.
 *
 * TIER 3 (same chunk, either property set): baselined against
 * `KNOWN_SAME_CHUNK_MERGES`. Added by bead enhancedchannelmanager-mklhu.
 *
 * Tiers 1 and 2 both key collisions on CHUNK IDENTITY — they fire when a bare
 * selector is declared in two DIFFERENT chunks. That is exactly right for the
 * visit-order defect above, and BLIND BY CONSTRUCTION to the case where both
 * files are in the SAME chunk. The eager bundle is one chunk carrying
 * index.css, common.css, App.css, ChannelsPane.css, StreamsPane.css,
 * ModalBase.css and ~35 more, so "same chunk" covers most of the tree.
 *
 * That blind spot shipped a P1. `ChannelProfilesListModal.css` and
 * `ChannelsPane.css` both declared `.channel-item`; both eager; ChannelsPane is
 * emitted later, so its `display: grid` beat the modal's `display: flex` while
 * the modal's `gap` survived, and Manage Channels rendered channel names inside
 * a 32px grid track. Tiers 1 and 2 were green the whole time. Fixed in 266356ff.
 *
 * So TIER 3 keys on BYTE ORDER WITHIN A CHUNK instead — see
 * `deriveEmissionRank()` for the model and for how it was validated against two
 * real builds. It reports a selector declared by TWO OR MORE FILES of one
 * chunk, classified by `classifySameChunkGroup()`:
 *   - PARTIAL  the rendered element draws from more than one file. This is the
 *              `.channel-item` shape: a merge of two authors' intentions that
 *              neither wrote. 17 when this tier landed, 0 today — bead
 *              enhancedchannelmanager-87o0c reconciled them.
 *   - SHADOW   the last-emitted file wins every contended property, so the
 *              earlier copy is dead weight. Harmless today, and one deleted
 *              property away from PARTIAL — tracked, not ignored, because the
 *              commit that adds the duplicate and the commit that makes it
 *              render wrong are usually different commits, and only tracking
 *              both puts the failure on the one that introduced it. 14 when
 *              this tier landed, 0 today (same bead).
 *   - DISJOINT the files declare non-overlapping properties, so nothing
 *              contends. NOT reported, for the same reason TIER 2 requires a
 *              shared property. 5 today.
 * A shape flip in either direction fails the check, as does a moved chunk.
 *
 * TIER 3 also closes tiers 1/2's largest known gap: it expands shorthands, so
 * `padding` and `padding-left` contend. That was measured before adopting —
 * see `SHORTHAND_SLOTS` — and costs zero extra reported selectors.
 *
 * WHAT TIER 3 STILL CANNOT SEE, measured rather than guessed:
 *   - `deriveChunks()` collapses everything statically reachable from the entry
 *     into one EAGER bucket, but the real build splits off any module that the
 *     entry AND every lazy root reach: today that is Toast.css + ToastContainer
 *     .css, emitted as NotificationContext-*.css and <link>ed BEFORE index-*.css.
 *     Those two files therefore sit in a different stylesheet from the rest of
 *     EAGER, and a collision between them and (say) common.css would be labelled
 *     same-chunk here. It would still be a real, deterministic override in the
 *     same direction — the emission rank and the <link> order agree — so the
 *     verdict is right and only the word "chunk" is loose. Neither file
 *     participates in any collision today. Unifying the two chunk models is
 *     follow-up work, not a correctness hole in the reported set.
 *   - Properties outside TIER1+TIER2's lists (transition, transform, ...) are
 *     invisible, so a group whose ONLY surviving contribution from the earlier
 *     file is such a property is classified SHADOW rather than PARTIAL.
 *   - Two rules in ONE file are skipped: that is the author's own ordering, not
 *     a collision between two authors.
 *   - Scoping a rule makes it a different key and therefore invisible, exactly
 *     as in tiers 1 and 2. That is the intended fix, not a gap.
 *
 * WHEN ANY OF THE THREE FAILS: do not scope-and-move-on and do not add a
 * baseline entry for new work. Delete the page copy and let the shared layer
 * own the class (leaving the pointer comment behind), or scope the page copy to
 * a page-root ancestor so it can no longer leak. See docs/css_guidelines.md
 * § Load order.
 *
 * NOTE ON `postcss`: declared as an explicit devDependency of
 * frontend/package.json (previously resolved only transitively through
 * vite, which was fragile — a vite upgrade could have dropped it and broken
 * this guard with a confusing error).

 *   paint          color/background/border/radius/shadow/opacity
 *   text layout    text-align/white-space/text-overflow/overflow — truncation
 *   cursor         an affordance flip (pointer vs default) is a real defect
 *
 * OUT — measured on this tree before excluding, not assumed:

 *     Excluding them costs zero coverage today: all 3 sit on selectors
 *     (.drag-handle, .settings-btn, .group-item) this tier already catches
 *     via other properties.
 *   font-family, text-decoration, vertical-align, box-sizing, visibility,

 * (DummyEPGChannelPicker.css -- its component is reached only from the dev
