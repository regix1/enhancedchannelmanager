/**
 * Polling hook for a DBAS Phase-2 restore / dry-run progress surface.
 *
 * Mirrors the poll / abort / cleanup conventions of
 * `useChannelPipelineExecution.ts` (`pollExecutionUntilTerminal`): a steady
 * interval of cheap GETs against the task status endpoint, stop on a terminal
 * status, honor an AbortSignal both before each fetch and inside the inter-poll
 * sleep, and clear the interval on unmount so no timer leaks (there is a known
 * dnd/observer-leak discipline in this repo — the same applies to polling
 * timers).
 *
 * SEAM: the restore-trigger endpoint / restore TaskScheduler is a LATER bead.
 * The backend orchestrator (`backend/dbas/restore_orchestrator.py`, bead .18)
 * exists but does not yet emit `_set_progress`, and no restore task is wired to
 * `task_scheduler`. This hook therefore takes the `taskId` as a prop/seam and
 * polls the EXISTING generic task status endpoint (`getTask` →
 * `/api/tasks/{id}`), reading the REAL `TaskProgress` shape
 * (`backend/task_scheduler.py` — `TaskProgress.to_dict()`). When the restore
 * task lands and emits its stage via `current_item`, this hook needs no change.
