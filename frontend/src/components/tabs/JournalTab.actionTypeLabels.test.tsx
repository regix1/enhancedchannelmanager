/**
 * Every label an operator is told to look for is the label they will see.
 *
 * The Journal filter dropdown offered "Merge Not Applied" and the row badge
 * rendered the same action type as "Merge Unapplied", because the badge went
 * through a generic title-case of the identifier. The Pending Merges notice
 * tells operators to look in the Journal under the FIRST wording — so an
 * operator who followed the instruction found a badge with different words and
 * nothing to tell them the two were the same row type.
 *
 * The property: for every action type with a hand-written label, the badge
 * rendered for a row of that type reads the SAME string the filter offers.
 * `ACTION_TYPE_LABELS` is what makes that structural — one entry feeds both —
 * so what is pinned here is the rendered output of each entry plus the
 * untouched generic path. Each hand-written label carries its own case: these
 * are assertions about specific action types, not an enumeration of the
 * dropdown.
 *
 * `bulk_merge_incomplete` joined later and shows why the last case matters.
 * The backend emits it for a bulk-merge group whose source channels are not
 * all gone, and `docs/api.md` tells an operator to filter the Journal on the
 * action type to find the merges that need attention — but it was in neither
 * the `JournalActionType` union nor `ACTION_TYPE_LABELS`, so it fell through
 * the generic transform and was absent from the Action dropdown entirely. The
 * advice named a filter that did not exist.
