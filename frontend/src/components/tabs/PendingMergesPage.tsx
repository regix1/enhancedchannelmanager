/**
 * PendingMergesPage — operator-facing queue view for stream-to-channel
 * deduplication candidates (BD-J / bd-gfxrz, ADR-008 §D1).
 *
 * Where it lives: this page is a SUB-VIEW of the Channel Manager tab, not a
 * new top-level tab. The top tab bar is already at 10 entries, and the UX-
 * ratified spec in the parent epic (bd-1v4ht) places this surface in the
 * Channel Manager subnav with a count badge that appears only when there is
 * something to act on (or when the operator is already on this page).
 *
 * Data source:
 *   GET  /api/channel-merges?status=pending&page=1&page_size=50  (BD-E list)
 *   POST /api/channel-merges/{id}/accept                         (BD-E merge)
 *   POST /api/channel-merges/{id}/dismiss                        (BD-E dismiss)
 *
 * Per-row affordances:
 *   - "Merge" — accept the candidate. Idempotent on the backend per ADR-008
 *     §D1; when it APPLIES we optimistically remove the row from the local
 *     list. When ECM could not apply it upstream the backend deliberately
 *     leaves the row in `pending` with an `unapplied_reason`, so the row stays
 *     here too, flagged in place and retryable (bead
 *     enhancedchannelmanager-i5ic0, PO decision 2026-08-16). Removing it would
 *     put this list out of step with the queue and take the retry away.
 *   - "Create New" — dismiss the candidate (the actual channel-creation path
 *     is the operator's next trigger — drag-drop, Add Stream, or the next
 *     M3U refresh — and `dismiss` is a pure ECM-side state flip plus audit
 *     row per ADR-008 §D6). Always terminal, so always an optimistic remove.
 *
 * On error, the backend's `detail` string is surfaced verbatim in an inline
 * banner (matching the bd-7j6v1 / bd-9q9z0 pattern); the row stays in place
 * so the operator can retry or pick the other action.
 *
 * Bulk actions (GH #642 / bead enhancedchannelmanager-ixcf1) reuse those same
 * endpoints sequentially. Sequential execution prevents a bulk click from
 * amplifying concurrent Dispatcharr mutations; failures do not stop later
 * rows, and a row is removed only when its outcome actually resolved it.

 * (bead enhancedchannelmanager-i5ic0, fix round):
 *
 * - `true`  — applied. No notice; there is nothing for the operator to do.
 * - `false` — recorded and NOT applied upstream. `kind: 'unapplied'`.
 * - `null`  — an idempotent replay, which made no Dispatcharr call and has no
 *   evidence about what the original one did. `kind: 'unknown'`. Round 1
 *   tested `!== false` and so consumed this through the success path: the row
 *   was removed with no explanation and a bulk run counted it as a clean
 *   apply, which is the only outcome that says "ECM does not know" being shown
 *   as the one thing it is not.
 *
 * Held at page level because a `kind: 'unknown'` replay DOES remove its row —
 * that row is terminal and a `status=pending` reload would not return it — so
 * the notice is the only place its explanation can live.
 *
 * `kind: 'unapplied'` also keeps its notice, but it is no longer the only
 * signal: since the PO decision of 2026-08-16 that row STAYS in the queue
 * carrying `unapplied_reason`, flagged in place and retryable (bead
 * enhancedchannelmanager-i5ic0). The notice is the summary of what a click or
 * a bulk run just did; the row badge is where the operator finds it afterwards.
