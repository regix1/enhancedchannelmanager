 * of the same ids. Three lists meant every added or retired destination had to
 * be edited in three places, and the import direction ran the wrong way to fix
 * it (`settingsSections.ts` imported the union from the router). The direction
 * is now reversed: `SECTION_DEFINITIONS` below is the only place a settings id
