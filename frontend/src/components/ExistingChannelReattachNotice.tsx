/**
 * Says what a restore did (or would do) to channels it did NOT create (bead dfkbn).
 *
 * The number that matters here is `existing_channels`: channels the operator
 * already had, whose live guide link or logo was replaced by the archive's. That
 * is not recoverable: the rollback ledger compensates CREATES, so nothing undoes
 * a PATCH onto a channel the restore did not make.
 *
 * It renders on the DRY RUN too, from the same report fields, which is the whole
 * point: the operator has to be able to see the destructive count BEFORE the
 * apply, not read about it afterwards. A preview that could not predict this
 * would repeat bead dgnms, where a preview mispredicted a whole category.
 *
 * Silent when there is nothing to say (an empty destination creates every
 * channel, so both populations are zero and the mode never mattered).
 *
 * CHANNEL GROUPING (bead r1ei7) is the third thing the mode governs, and it is
 * the one `preserve` still reports. A channel that already exists is never
 * overwritten, so on a populated target the lineup keeps whatever grouping the
 * destination had — drill run 12 measured seven channels in the wrong group,
 * in BOTH modes, behind a `success / failed 0` report whose counts reconciled
 * exactly. Under `preserve` the rows say what diverged and that nothing was
 * touched; under `overwrite` they say what moved.
 *
 * And when the grouping check did NOT run — the operator deselected the channel
 * groups category — the panel renders for that alone, carrying the server's
 * `channel_group_drift_note`. Otherwise a restore that examined nothing would
 * look identical to one that examined everything and found nothing, which is
 * the failure mode this whole panel exists to end.
