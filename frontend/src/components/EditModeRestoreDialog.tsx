/**
 * The offer an operator gets on returning to a tab that still holds staged
 * Edit Mode work from a session that died (epic enhancedchannelmanager-r93hq).
 *
 * WHY AN OFFER RATHER THAN AN AUTOMATIC RESTORE. Staged operations name
 * channel ids, group ids and stream ids, and any of them can have moved while
 * the session was dead — a channel deleted, a group renamed away, numbers
 * reassigned by another operator or by a pipeline run. Some of the ledger may
 * therefore not be applicable at all. Restoring silently would drop the
 * operator back into Edit Mode holding a ledger quietly smaller than the one
 * they left, with no way to see which changes went or why, and the next thing
 * they do is press Apply. A partial restore is fine; a partial restore nobody
 * was told about is not.
 *
 * SO THE ACCOUNT IS NOT COLLAPSIBLE AND NOT TRUNCATED. Every dropped operation
 * gets its own line naming what it was and what moved, and so does every
 * duplicate-number confirmation the lineup outgrew — that change IS coming
 * back, but the operator has to know it will be asked about again rather than
 * discovering it at Apply.
 *
 * NEITHER BUTTON IS A DEFAULT ESCAPE. There is no Escape handler and no
 * click-away: both would destroy staged work by accident, which is the exact
 * failure the epic's exit guard exists to stop. That is also why this dialog
 * does NOT compose `ModalOverlay`, whose entire behaviour is Escape-to-close;
 * it marks its own backdrop `data-modal-overlay` instead, which is what the
 * shared focus lifecycle keys Tab containment off and what
 * `e2e/visual/modal-typography-inventory.spec.ts` counts as a real modal. The
 * two are deliberately separable: this dialog takes the focus contract and
 * declines the dismissal one.
 *
 * FOCUS LANDS ON RESTORE, NOT DISCARD. `useModalFocusLifecycle` would
 * otherwise take the first focusable control, and the first control here
 * throws staged work away — one stray Enter from an operator who has not read
 * the account yet. When nothing is restorable there is no Restore button, and
 * the fallback is the only remaining action.
