/**
 * StreamReattachNotice — the restore-complete "these channels cannot play"
 * action item (bead d0bd3), sibling of {@link CredentialReentryNotice}.
 *
 * Backup/restore drill run 2026-08-06-run9 restored a redacted artifact onto a
 * fresh target. The report was right about everything:
 * `channels_needing_stream_reattach: 12`, `channels_with_no_playable_stream: 12`,
 * and all twelve channels named in `stream_reattach_details`. The
 * restore-complete dialog showed the credentials panel and the per-category
 * count grid, and nothing else. Nowhere on screen did it say that not one
 * channel could play — measured at the same moment as 0/2 playback, HTTP 500.
 *
 * The product's own documentation tells operators "the UI shows matching panels
 * after a restore … use these instead of re-deriving the same information by
 * hand", so an operator who followed that advice concluded the only outstanding
 * item was a credential, on an instance that played nothing. The report data was
 * already correct; only this panel was missing.
 *
 * TWO POPULATIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS NOT BROKEN
 * -------------------------------------------
 * `channels_needing_stream_reattach` counts every channel left holding a
 * URL-less placeholder slot. `channels_with_no_playable_stream` is the SUBSET
 * with no URL-bearing stream at all (bead daziw). Only the subset is broken:
 * a channel that kept its real streams and holds one leftover placeholder is
 * the designed output of the ixdaw fix ("costs one slot instead of the entire
 * channel") and plays fine. Collapsing the two would either cry wolf over a
 * working channel or bury a dead one, so the panel names them separately and
 * only the dead population raises `role="alert"`.
 *
 * DRY RUN: silent. Both counters read `null` — NOT PREDICTED — on a preview
 * (bead dgnms), because the rebind pass that answers them re-matches against
 * provider streams a deferred M3U refresh materializes, and a preview refreshes
 * nothing. Rendering `null` as `0` is the confident claim that null exists to
 * stop making.
 *
 * Colorblind-safe (WCAG 1.4.1): meaning is carried by the icon and the words
 * "no playable stream" / "placeholder" in the copy, never by colour alone.
