/**
 * The offer an operator sees on returning to a tab that still holds staged
 * Edit Mode work from a session that died (epic enhancedchannelmanager-r93hq).
 *
 * WHY AN OFFER AND NOT AN AUTOMATIC RESTORE. The staged operations name
 * channel ids, group ids and stream ids that could have moved while the
 * session was dead, so some of them may no longer be applicable at all.
 * Restoring silently would put the operator back into Edit Mode holding a
 * ledger that is quietly smaller than the one they left, with no way to know
 * which changes went or why — and the next thing they do is press Apply. The
 * dialog exists to make the account unmissable BEFORE any of it becomes live
 * staged work.
 *
 * SO THE ACCOUNT IS NOT COLLAPSIBLE AND NOT TRUNCATED. Every dropped operation
 * gets a line naming what it was and what moved. A "3 changes could not be
 * restored" summary behind a disclosure triangle would satisfy a presence
 * assertion and fail the operator.
