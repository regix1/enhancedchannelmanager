/**
 * Cross-Instance Sync card (epic i39wu / bead nnl9s) — the first operator-facing
 * surface for one-way config sync from this instance (A) to a managed replica (B).
 *
 * Mirrors the EncryptedBackupCard precedent: a focused card inside Settings ->
 * Backup & Restore, admin-gated by the section it mounts into.
 *
 * Load-bearing operator-expectation copy (ADR-013) is surfaced prominently:
 *   - sync is ONE-WAY — edits on B are overwritten by A on the next apply;
 *   - provider credentials ARE synced, on every cycle (PO ruling 2026-08-22),
 *     so B authenticates and serves without the operator typing anything.
 *
 * THAT SECOND LINE USED TO SAY THE OPPOSITE, and getting it wrong is the whole
 * of bead `…-msqf7`. That bead was not about transmitting credentials; it was
 * about ECM asserting they were stripped while transmitting them anyway. The
 * copy below therefore changes in the same commit as the behaviour, and the
 * `key_off` "credentials are not synced" banner is replaced by a `key` banner
 * that says what actually happens — including the part an operator has to
 * weigh, which is that a target with certificate checking off carries those
 * credentials in clear on every cycle.
 *
 * Logo replication is per-target (`sync_logos`, default ON since bead 2yq19)
 * with its own row toggle — see `handleToggleLogos`. It still does not run
 * every cycle: `logo_sync_interval_hours` throttles the slice instead.
 *
 * Safety model for "Sync now": the default action is a counts-only DRY-RUN
 * preview (confirm_apply:false). Only after a successful preview does an
 * explicit, confirm-gated "Apply" (confirm_apply:true) become available — apply
 * is a source-wins overwrite of B, so we make the operator confirm it.
 *
 * `result.success` is the ONLY thing that unlocks Apply, which makes the
 * backend's TaskResult the whole safety mechanism. It has to be trustworthy: a
 * preview that could not read B used to arrive here as success=true with
 * would-create counts derived purely from A (bead …-jqfxm), so the card offered
 * Apply for a destination nobody had reached. The backend now fails such a
 * preview; this card needs no extra check, only to keep gating on `success`.
 *
 * Correcting a target in place (bead …-a3lby) — see `handleSave`. Every field
 * the create form sets was WRITE-ONCE here, so a mistyped base URL or password
 * meant delete-and-recreate: that resets `sync_logos` to its default and
 * hands the replacement the deleted target's execution history, which is keyed
 * on a REUSABLE target id (bead …-5dp92). The backend PUT and the api.ts client
 * already accepted every one of those fields; only this affordance was absent.

   * 2. Credentials are ALL-OR-NOTHING. The backend REPLACES the stored dict
   *    rather than merging into it, and ECM cannot read the stored secret back
   *    to fill a gap, so a half-entry would blank the half left empty. Blank
   *    boxes therefore omit `credentials` entirely (the stored secret is
