/**
 * Every visible text node on every route clears WCAG AA contrast, in all three
 * themes, at both supported viewports.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every contrast figure this project has ever quoted came from
 * an ephemeral auditor that no longer exists — a throwaway script, run once,
 * its numbers copied into a bead. Bead `enhancedchannelmanager-dlavh` moved the
 * live failure count from 140 to 34 that way and nothing has been able to
 * confirm it since. Worse, three of the figures in that bead's own description
 * turned out to be wrong and had to be retracted in a follow-up comment. An
 * unrepeatable measurement is not evidence, and a remediation nobody can re-run
 * is a claim, not a guarantee. This spec is the repeatable measurement.
 *
 * WHAT ALREADY EXISTED, AND WHY IT IS NOT ENOUGH. `e2e/operator-shell.spec.ts`
 * has two contrast tests (`Channel Manager group text ...`, `Dashboard and
 * header status ...`), both 2 viewports x 3 themes. They are SELECTOR LISTS —
 * nine to eleven named selectors on two routes. A component nobody thought to
 * add is invisible to them, which is exactly how the five failing
 * `.dashboard-card-icon` glyphs survived on the route that test walks. This
 * spec is the complement: a text-node WALK across all eleven routes, so a
 * brand-new component cannot slip past by not being on anybody's list.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * HOW IT MEASURES, AND WHY EACH STEP IS THERE
 *
 * Every arm below exists because its absence produced a confidently wrong
 * number that somebody then acted on.
 *
 * 1. THE COMPOSITOR RESOLVES THE COLOUR, NOT A REGEX.
 *    `getComputedStyle(el).backgroundColor` for
 *    `color-mix(in srgb, var(--bg-secondary) 94%, transparent)` serialises as
 *    `color(srgb 0.960784 0.960784 0.960784 / 0.94)`. An `rgba()`-only regex
 *    returns nothing for it and the layer gets treated as transparent; a
 *    "grab all the numbers" regex reads those 0-1 floats as 0-255 channels and
 *    calls a near-white surface near-BLACK. Both mistakes are live in this
 *    repo's history: the first under-read the sticky-nav pill backdrop as
 *    #f0f0ff instead of the #e7e8f7 that is actually painted (reporting 3.96
 *    where the truth is 3.68), and the second sat latent in
 *    `computedTextContrast` in `operator-shell.spec.ts` until bead
 *    `enhancedchannelmanager-pbkwo` replaced it with this technique. That
 *    function now carries its own copy of the core below. A `page.evaluate`
 *    body is serialised into the browser and cannot reach a module import, and
 *    this file runs its copy inside ONE whole-page evaluate over thousands of
 *    nodes rather than per element, so the two cannot share one definition.
 *    A change to the model belongs in both.
 *    So no colour is parsed here at all. Each one is handed to a 1x1 canvas and
 *    the pixel is read back, which means the engine that painted the page is
 *    the thing that resolves the syntax — `color()`, `oklch()`, `color-mix()`,
 *    and whatever ships next. This is the colour-space analogue of
 *    `control-typeface.spec.ts` measuring the rendered face instead of
 *    comparing `font-family` declarations: resolve it, do not read it.
 *
 * 2. THE BACKGROUND IS THE WHOLE ANCESTOR CHAIN, IN ORDER.
 *    Reading the parent's `background-color` alone is the bug that made an
 *    earlier auditor report every primary button as white-on-page. A button
 *    paints its own opaque fill and a translucent tint three ancestors up has
 *    to be composited in sequence.
 *
 * 3. `opacity` IS A GROUP MULTIPLIER, NOT A TEXT PROPERTY.
 *    An element with `opacity < 1` fades its entire subtree render — its own
 *    background and its text alike — onto whatever is behind it. That is why
 *    the Stats 64px `tv_off` illustration lands at 2.11 and not at the 4.2 its
 *    declared `color` alone would suggest.
 *
 * 3a. AND IT ONLY EVER FADES DOWNWARD. `chainOf` walks UPWARD because that is
 *    the only direction the DOM offers, but the alpha a node's background is
 *    painted at is the product of its own `opacity` and its ANCESTORS' — a
 *    descendant's `opacity` cannot reach back up and fade the surface the
 *    descendant is sitting on. Accumulating in walk order and stamping the
 *    running product onto each layer as it goes gets this exactly backwards,
 *    and that is the bug bead `enhancedchannelmanager-0zq1p` fixed: an element
 *    at `opacity: .5` had its whole page background painted at 0.5 over the
 *    canvas's white, so the guard read a backdrop nothing on screen was
 *    painting. `.probe-group-btn .material-icons` in dark sits on `#1e1e23`
 *    (only `.channels-pane` and `html` paint, both `rgb(30,30,35)`); the old
 *    core resolved `#56565a`, which is `#1e1e23` composited twice at alpha 0.5
 *    over white. Three independent readings settled it: a screenshot of the
 *    rendered page sampled inside the glyph's own box (mode `#1e1e23`, ink
 *    `#575761`), the sibling text in `.no-streams` which has `opacity: 1` and
 *    must by construction share its surface (`#252530` dark / `#f5f5f5` light /
 *    `#0a0a0a` high-contrast — what the corrected core returns for the glyph,
 *    not what the old one did), and the arithmetic. The error was invisible in
 *    light because leaking the white canvas into a near-white page is a
 *    near-no-op, which is the theme the original was validated against.
 *
 *    `selfOpacity` was NOT part of the bug and is unchanged: the measured
 *    element's text really is inside every group in the chain, so the full
 *    product is the right alpha for the ink.
 *
 *    KNOWN RESIDUAL, deliberately not fixed: `paint()` composites one
 *    `fillRect` per layer, which reproduces the compositor exactly unless a
 *    translucent group paints an OPAQUE background over another opaque one
 *    (true nesting would flatten the group into a buffer first and composite
 *    once). Measured across all 8277 sites this guard walks: zero such chains
 *    today. If one appears the model needs the buffer, not another alpha term.
 *
 * 4. NOT-ACTUALLY-VISIBLE IS SKIPPED, AND THAT IS NOT A LOOPHOLE.
 *    `.visually-hidden` is a 1x1 clipped box. A naive walker reports it as
 *    failing, which is correct behaviour being mis-reported — it cost 28
 *    phantom findings in one session. Same for zero-size, offscreen,
 *    `visibility: hidden`, `opacity: 0`, and `[disabled]` subtrees, which
 *    WCAG 1.4.3 exempts and which this app dims with an `opacity` that would
 *    otherwise read as a defect. `e2e/sr-only-hidden.spec.ts` is what keeps
 *    the screen-reader utilities genuinely hidden; this spec trusts it.
 *
 * 5. WHAT IT CANNOT MEASURE, IT REFUSES TO PASS.
 *    A `background-image` (gradient, texture) in the chain cannot be reduced
 *    to one colour, and a colour the engine will not resolve cannot be
 *    composited. Both are reported as UNRESOLVED and both fail the run. There
 *    are zero of either today. If one appears, the guard must be taught to
 *    handle it — silently skipping it is how a guard starts lying.
 *
 * FLOORS. WCAG 1.4.3: 4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 "large scale" (18pt/24px, or
 * 14pt/18.66px when bold). WCAG 1.4.11: 3:1 for non-text content, which is what
 * an icon-font glyph is.
 *
 * VIEWPORTS. 1280x720 and 1920x1080. 1280x720 is the PO's stated minimum
 * supported viewport, and it is not redundant with 1920: the sticky section nav
 * changes placement at 1100px and 850px, and a route that reflows can change
 * which surface a label sits on.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES: the build being SERVED, not the working tree. Against a
 * stale container this reports the stale CSS. Deploy first, or point
 * `E2E_BASE_URL` at a build of the tree under test.
 *
 * WHY THE CONTEXT IS WARM, unlike `sr-only-hidden.spec.ts`. Route stylesheets
 * are appended to <head> on first visit and never removed, so by the last route
 * every chunk's CSS is live. That is the state a real operator's session is in
 * after a few clicks, and it is the state in which a cross-chunk override can
 * change a colour. A cold-per-route walk would measure a session nobody has.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THERE IS AN ALLOWLIST, AND WHY IT CANNOT ROT
 *
 * Same discipline as `e2e/route-typography-scale.spec.ts`. Four arms, and the
 * last three are the load-bearing ones:
 *
 *   NEW        a failing site matching no entry                    -> FAIL
 *   STALE      an entry whose sites all now clear their floor      -> FAIL
 *                                                                    (delete it)
 *   MISSING    an entry matching nothing, not `dataDependent`      -> FAIL
 *   REGRESSED  a matched site that got WORSE than its recorded
 *              ratio by more than RATIO_TOLERANCE                  -> FAIL
 *
 * STALE means fixing a site REQUIRES deleting its entry in the same commit.
 * REGRESSED means an entry is a ceiling, not a blank cheque: an allowed 2.13
 * cannot quietly drift to 1.4. Every entry names an OPEN bead — an entry
 * pointing at a closed bead is an entry nobody owns.
 *
 * NOT VACUOUS. Every route asserts a floor on how many text elements it
 * measured. Without it a route that failed to mount contributes zero failures
 * and reads as a pass, which is the likeliest way a guard like this dies
 * quietly.

 *   - `.sticky-section-nav button[aria-current="location"]` (Stats + Settings)
 *     and `.settings-nav-item.active .navigation-label` — the three sites bead
 *     `enhancedchannelmanager-dlavh` reported. Fixed in the same change that
 *     added this spec by retoning light `--accent-secondary` #6366f1 -> #3e41ee;
 *     measured 3.68 and 3.25 before, 5.41 and 4.79 after, with dark (10.47 /
 *     9.76) and high-contrast (15.31 / 14.04) untouched. They are the proof this
 *     guard goes red on a real defect rather than being decoration.
 *   - `.failed-streams-alert` on Channel Manager. It WAS added here, at a
 *     measured 4.40 light / 3.72 high-contrast — and the STALE arm rejected it
 *     on the next run. Both readings were taken 180ms after a theme switch,
 *     inside a `background-color` transition; at rest the same badge composites
 *     `--danger-text` #c21111 over #f3dcd9 and measures 4.75, which passes. The
 *     entry was deleted and `FREEZE_ANIMATION` added. Recorded because it is the
 *     clearest demonstration available that the ratchet catches a wrong entry —
 *     including the author's own — and not just a fixed one.
 *   - `.navigation-destination.active:not(.settings-nav-item) .navigation-label`
 *     — the selected primary-rail row, which this guard found and carried as its
 *     first entry at a measured 4.20 light. The PO chose the 9% tint over
 *     retoning `--accent-primary`, on bead `enhancedchannelmanager-dlavh`;
 *     `TabNavigation.css` now paints `color-mix(... 9%, transparent)` and it
 *     measures 4.51 light, with dark 9.05 -> 10.73 and high-contrast
 *     12.24 -> 14.31 (both were already passing; the wash changed in all three
 *     themes, which is the cost the PO accepted). `e2e/frozen-chrome.spec.ts`
 *     pins the rail's geometry, not its colour, and was re-run to confirm it.
 *   - `.probe-group-btn .material-icons` on Channel Manager — the only entry this
 *     guard ever carried that failed in all three themes. An icon-only button
 *     with no adjacent label, so the glyph is the affordance and the decorative
 *     exemption did not apply. Fixed on the same PO decision by raising the idle
 *     opacity 0.5 -> 0.75 (`ChannelsPane.css`).
 *
 *     RE-MEASURED under the corrected core (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-0zq1p`);
 *     the figures this entry carried while it was live — 1.56 / 2.10 / 2.25 at
 *     0.5, and 3.15 / 3.28 / 5.02 at 0.75 — were the old core's and are wrong in
 *     dark and high-contrast. True, dark / light / high-contrast:
 *         opacity 0.50   2.32 / 2.10 / 2.82   (fails all three — still a defect)
 *         opacity 0.70   3.30 / 3.00 / 4.69
 *         opacity 0.75   3.55 / 3.28 / 5.24   (shipped)
 *     So the fix was right and the entry's deletion was right; only the numbers
 *     were. 0.70 was rejected at the time on a reported 2.76 dark that the old
 *     core invented — it does in fact clear 3:1 in all three themes, with light
 *     sitting exactly ON the floor at 3.00 and no margin at all. 0.75 stands as
 *     shipped; nothing here is a reason to re-open a settled PO decision.
