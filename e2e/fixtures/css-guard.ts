/**
 * Shared plumbing for the three rendered-CSS regression guards:
 *
 *   - `e2e/sr-only-hidden.spec.ts`        screen-reader-only utility stays hidden
 *   - `e2e/frozen-chrome.spec.ts`         the shell's frozen constants
 *   - `e2e/route-typography-scale.spec.ts` the P1 type scale
 *
 * All three need the same three things, and all three get them wrong in the
 * same expensive ways if each rolls its own:
 *
 * 1. ONE LOGIN PER SPEC FILE. `backend/auth/routes.py` rate-limits the login
 *    endpoint at `5/minute`. These guards open many browser contexts (a cold
 *    one per route; one per theme x viewport), and a context per login blows
 *    that budget instantly — the failure surfaces as
 *    `Login failed: Too Many Requests`, which reads like a broken assertion
 *    and is really a self-inflicted flake. `captureStorageState()` logs in
 *    exactly once and every later context is created from the returned
 *    cookies + localStorage. A context built this way is still COLD in the
 *    sense that matters for these guards: no tab chunk has been fetched, so
 *    no lazily-appended stylesheet is in <head>.
 *
 * 2. HASH NAVIGATION, NEVER `page.reload()`. Every route tab is a lazily
 *    imported chunk whose stylesheet is appended to <head> on first visit and
 *    never removed. A reload throws all of them away, which resets the exact
 *    state these guards observe and would silently turn a real failure into a
 *    pass. `navigateToTab()` in `fixtures/base.ts` reloads on its recovery
 *    path, and cannot leave Settings (Settings replaces the primary rail with
 *    its own), so it is unusable here.
 *
 * 3. AN EXPLICIT `waitFor` ON THE LOGIN GATE. `isVisible({ timeout })` is a
 *    no-op in Playwright — the option is ignored and the call returns the
 *    current state immediately — so a still-rendering login form reads as
 *    "not a login page" and the run proceeds into a blank shell.
 *
 * 4. A STATED AUTH POSTURE WHEN THERE IS NO BACKEND. See
 *    `stubAuthPostureWhenBackendless()` below: on the `E2E_EXACT_BUILD`
 *    preview build there is no server to answer the posture probes, and the
 *    app now declines to guess one.

/**
 * State the instance's auth posture when the run has no backend to ask.
 *
 * `E2E_EXACT_BUILD=true` builds the checked-out source and serves it on an
 * isolated preview port with NO backend — that is what the flag means, and it
 * is the mode the `Screen-Reader-Only Rendering Guard` CI job used before that
 * job was removed, and the mode these specs are still run by hand in
 * (`docs/testing.md` § "Rendered-CSS regression guards"). Every `/api` call
 * fails there, including the two auth-posture probes `ProtectedRoute` gates
 * the whole app on.
 *
 * That used to render the app shell anyway, because `useAuthRequired()`
 * resolved an unanswered probe to "auth is not required" and the setup probe's
 * catch did the same. Bead `enhancedchannelmanager-p388h` removed that
 * fail-open: an unresolved posture renders a retryable "Cannot reach ECM"
 * screen instead of the app. That is the correct product behaviour — a
 * degraded backend must not produce a sessionless app shell — and it is also
 * the exact screen this fixture was left staring at, with `.tab-navigation`
 * never appearing and the 30s `waitForSelector` timing out. The fixture was
 * riding the defect, so the fixture is what changes.
 *
 * These four routes are the same set `openDeterministicOperatorShell()`
 * (`e2e/operator-shell.spec.ts:183`) and `openApp()`
 * (`e2e/filter-select-ownership.spec.ts:29`) already install for the same
 * reason on the same backend-less preview build. The posture the three of them
 * state is identical, `require_auth: false` with `setup_complete: true` and no
 * session; only `dispatcharr_enabled`, which nothing here reads, differs
 * between them. It describes the instance these guards have always measured.
 *
 * ONLY the posture probes are stubbed. Every data endpoint still fails exactly
 * as it did before, so each route renders the same empty and error states this
 * guard family has always measured — the rendered CSS under test is unchanged.
 *
 * Gated on `E2E_EXACT_BUILD` because that flag IS the backend-less mode. The
 * other six guards in this family run against a live ECM container on :6100
 * and must keep exercising its real auth posture and its real login.
