/**
 * The P1 type scale holds across every route's content pane.
 *
 * THE SCALE (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-f4yc7`, PO preset P1):
 *
 *   metric      20px / 600        status icon   18px
 *   section     15px / 600        action icon   16px
 *   body        13px / 400        small icon    14px
 *   meta        11px / 400        empty-state   64px
 *   micro/badge 10px
 *
 * so a visible text node in a route's content pane must compute to one of
 * {20, 15, 13, 11, 10} px, or one of the icon sizes {18, 16, 14, 64} px.
 * Nothing else. `em`/`rem`-relative and bare user-agent sizes are the two
 * ways sites drift off it, and both show up here as odd values — 13.3333px
 * (an unstyled UA `<button>`), 14.4px / 9.6px (`0.9em` / `0.6em` compounding),
 * 17.6px / 10.4px (`1.1rem` / `0.65rem`), 24px (a Material Icons default that
 * was never given an icon role).
 *
 * SCOPE. The primary rail and the top band are EXCLUDED. Both were settled by
 * beads `-57pp3` and `-eupzi` and are explicitly out of scope for the content
 * scale — `e2e/frozen-chrome.spec.ts` pins them instead. Screen-reader-only
 * elements are excluded too: they are 1x1 clipped boxes, not visible text
 * (`e2e/sr-only-hidden.spec.ts` is what keeps them that way).
 *
 * ONE SUBTREE IS EXCLUDED BY DOM POSITION AND SHOULD NOT BE: the notification
 * panel. It is a child of `.notification-center`, which is a child of
 * `.header-actions`, so `.header` catches it — but it is not the frozen band.
 * The band exclusion exists for the band's OWN controls, whose sizes `-57pp3`
 * and `-eupzi` deliberately froze at chrome values (a 20px glyph, a 28px
 * control). The panel is a 380px content overlay that merely hangs off one of
 * those controls: it holds item titles, running text, timestamps and status
 * glyphs, which is exactly the vocabulary the P1 roles name. `RE_INCLUDED_
 * ANCESTORS` below puts it back in scope. Bead
 * `enhancedchannelmanager-9bpkk`, which found the panel rendering 16px
 * inherited body text, 14.4px item titles and 22px status glyphs — none of it
 * visible to any guard, because it is only in the DOM while it is open.
 *
 * THE PANEL HAS TO BE OPENED, AND IT HAS TO HAVE CONTENT. It is not in the
 * 82-dialog harness (that harness opens modals; this is a popover), and it
 * renders nothing at all until the bell is clicked. `ensurePanelOpen()` does
 * the click; `MIN_PANEL_TEXT_ELEMENTS` is the non-vacuity floor, and it is set
 * ABOVE what the empty state alone can produce on purpose — an empty panel
 * renders one glyph and one line of text, both on scale, and would sail
 * through a guard that only checked "did anything go off scale".
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THERE IS AN ALLOWLIST, AND WHY IT CANNOT ROT
 *
 * Six of the ten routes have off-scale sites today. A guard that waited for
 * all of them to be fixed would ship on nobody's timetable and catch nothing
 * in the meantime; a guard with a plain "known exceptions, ignore these"
 * list would go permanently green and stop meaning anything the moment the
 * first one was fixed. So the allowlist is bidirectional, the same discipline
 * as TIER 2 of `frontend/src/cssAudits/sharedClassChunkLeak.audit.test.ts`:
 *
 *   NEW      an off-scale site matching no entry            -> FAIL
 *   STALE    an entry whose site renders and is now ON scale -> FAIL
 *                                                              (delete it)
 *   MISSING  an entry whose selector matches nothing, and
 *            which is not marked `dataDependent`             -> FAIL
 *
 * The STALE arm is the load-bearing one: it means fixing a site REQUIRES
 * deleting its entry in the same commit, and the list can never quietly
 * outlive the defects it describes. Every entry names an owning bead, so a
 * reader can always answer "who is going to fix this, and under what?".
 *
 * WHICH BEAD AN ENTRY NAMES. This list was first written while `-f4yc7` was the
 * only bead that had ever discussed the scale, so every entry cited it — and
 * `-f4yc7` then closed, leaving ten entries pointing at a bead nobody could
 * pick up. An entry naming a closed bead answers "under what?" with "nothing",
 * which is the same rot the STALE arm exists to prevent. The split now is:
 *
 *   PERMANENT frozen-band entries  ->  the bead whose PO decision FROZE them,
 *                                      `-f4yc7`. Closed is correct here: these
 *                                      record a settled decision, not pending
 *                                      work, and nothing is going to change.
 *   PENDING entries                ->  `enhancedchannelmanager-6z299.8`, the
 *                                      open completion pass that owns the
 *                                      remaining off-scale route text.
 *   this spec itself               ->  `enhancedchannelmanager-6z299.9`, the
 *                                      open bead that owns the rendered-CSS
 *                                      guards.
 *
 * Same rule in `e2e/contrast-aa.spec.ts`, which enforces it by convention too:
 * a pending exception cites an OPEN bead or it is not a pending exception.
 *
 * `dataDependent: true` marks a site that only renders when the instance has
 * the relevant records. This instance has almost none, so those entries
 * cannot be checked for staleness here — the flag is a documented admission,
 * not a hiding place, and everything without it is checked strictly.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * NOT VACUOUS. Every route asserts a floor on how many visible text elements
 * it walked. Without it, a route that failed to mount would contribute zero
 * off-scale sites and read as a pass — the single most likely way a guard
 * like this dies quietly.
 *
 * WHEN THIS FAILS ON A NEW SITE: give the element a P1 role from the
 * "Typography Roles" group in `frontend/src/index.css` rather than a literal px value, and delete
 * any `em`-relative size in its ancestor chain (an `em` size compounds and is
 * the reason 0.9em reads as 14.4px here and something else two levels down).
 * See docs/css_guidelines.md, bead enhancedchannelmanager-f4yc7 for the scale
 * itself, and bead enhancedchannelmanager-6z299.8 for the pages it has not
 * reached yet.
