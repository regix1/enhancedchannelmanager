# ECM API Reference

Interactive API documentation is available at `/api/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/api/redoc` (ReDoc). `/swagger` also redirects to `/api/docs` for convenience.

All API endpoints require JWT Bearer token authentication. To authenticate in the Swagger UI:

1. Call `POST /api/auth/login` with `{"username": "...", "password": "..."}`
2. Copy the `access_token` from the response
3. Click the **Authorize** button in the Swagger UI and enter the token

## Channels

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/channels` | List channels (paginated, searchable, filterable) |
| `POST /api/channels` | Create channel |
| `GET /api/channels/{id}` | Get channel details |
| `GET /api/channels/{id}/streams` | Get streams for a channel |
| `PATCH /api/channels/{id}` | Update channel |
| `DELETE /api/channels/{id}` | Delete channel |
| `POST /api/channels/{id}/add-stream` | Add stream to channel |
| `POST /api/channels/{id}/add-streams` | Add multiple streams to a channel in one Dispatcharr roundtrip (dedup, order preserved) |
| `POST /api/channels/{id}/remove-stream` | Remove stream from channel |
| `POST /api/channels/{id}/reorder-streams` | Reorder channel streams |
| `POST /api/channels/assign-numbers` | Bulk assign channel numbers |
| `POST /api/channels/bulk-commit` | Batch multiple channel operations in one request |
| `POST /api/channels/merge` | Merge duplicate channels |
| `POST /api/channels/clear-auto-created` | Clear auto-created flag from channels |
| `GET /api/channels/csv-template` | Download CSV template for channel import |
| `GET /api/channels/export-csv` | Export all channels to CSV |

### `POST /api/channels/{id}/add-streams`

Bulk variant of `/add-stream`: fetches the channel once, appends every requested stream that isn't already on it (in request order), and PUTs once — one Dispatcharr roundtrip total, regardless of batch size. The MCP `bulk_add_streams_to_channel` tool calls this instead of looping the single-add endpoint, which timed out on slow hardware for batches of ~10 streams (bd-02xjj / GH #223).

**Request body:**

```json
{ "stream_ids": [101, 102, 103] }
```

**Response: `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "channel": { "id": 12, "name": "ESPN", "streams": [5, 101, 102, 103] },
  "added": [101, 102, 103],
  "skipped": [],
  "total_streams": 4
}
```

`added` are the IDs actually appended; `skipped` are IDs already present on the channel. When every requested stream was already present, `channel` is the unmodified channel, `added` is `[]`, and no Dispatcharr write is performed.

### `POST /api/channels/bulk-commit` — operation schema

`operations` is a list of discriminated objects; the `type` string selects the shape. Unknown types or missing/mistyped fields return `422 Unprocessable Entity` with FastAPI's standard `detail` list — each entry's `loc` is `["body", "operations", <index>, "<field>"]`, so the response pinpoints the bad operation and field (the MCP `bulk_commit_channels` tool now surfaces this `detail` rather than a bare "HTTP 422" — bd-mjtxn / GH #224).

| `type` | Fields | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| `createChannel` | `tempId` (int, negative), `name` (str), `channelNumber` (float, opt), `groupId` (int, opt), `newGroupName` (str, opt), `logoId` (int, opt), `logoUrl` (str, opt), `tvgId` (str, opt), `tvcGuideStationId` (str, opt), `normalize` (bool, default `false`) | `tempId` is echoed back in `tempIdMap` → real id. Use `groupId` for an existing group or `newGroupName` to reference a group created in `groupsToCreate`. |
| `updateChannel` | `channelId` (int), `data` (dict) | `data` is forwarded as-is to Dispatcharr (e.g. `{"name": ..., "channel_group_id": ..., "tvg_id": ...}`). |
| `deleteChannel` | `channelId` (int) | |
| `addStreamToChannel` | `channelId` (int), `streamId` (int) | |
| `removeStreamFromChannel` | `channelId` (int), `streamId` (int) | |
| `reorderChannelStreams` | `channelId` (int), `streamIds` (list[int]) | New stream order; first = highest priority. |
| `bulkAssignChannelNumbers` | `channelIds` (list[int]), `startingNumber` (float, opt) | |
| `createGroup` | `name` (str) | Group name → real id appears in `groupIdMap`. |
| `deleteChannelGroup` | `groupId` (int) | |
| `renameChannelGroup` | `groupId` (int), `newName` (str) | |

Request-level fields: `operations` (required list), `groupsToCreate` (opt list of `{name, ...}` dicts to create before processing), `validateOnly` (bool, default `false` — return `validationIssues` without applying), `continueOnError` (bool, default `false`), `consolidate` (bool, default `false` — collapse redundant ops first).

Response: `{ success, operationsApplied, operationsFailed, errors, tempIdMap, groupIdMap, validationIssues, validationPassed }`. Pre-validation (missing referenced channels/streams) surfaces in `validationIssues` on a `200` response — only schema-shape failures produce a `422`.

## Channel Groups

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/channel-groups` | List all groups |
| `POST /api/channel-groups` | Create group |
| `PATCH /api/channel-groups/{id}` | Update group. Group names are unique in Dispatcharr, so renaming to a name another group holds returns `400` with the upstream detail rather than merging the two groups; `404` if the group is already gone. The name is sent verbatim — Dispatcharr trims surrounding whitespace before its unique check but compares case-sensitively |
| `DELETE /api/channel-groups/{id}` | Delete group |
| `GET /api/channel-groups/orphaned` | List orphaned groups (no streams, channels, or M3U association) |
| `DELETE /api/channel-groups/orphaned` | Delete orphaned groups (optionally specify group IDs) |
| `GET /api/channel-groups/hidden` | List hidden channel groups |
| `POST /api/channel-groups/{id}/restore` | Restore a hidden channel group |
| `GET /api/channel-groups/auto-created` | List groups with auto-created channels |
| `GET /api/channel-groups/with-streams` | List groups that have channels with streams |

## Channel Merges (Stream Deduplication)

The `/api/channel-merges/*` family is the API surface for the v0.17.1 interactive stream-to-channel deduplication feature (ADR-008). It exposes the pending merges queue, the synchronous candidate lookup, and the accept/dismiss decision endpoints.

See [`docs/user_guide/channels-streams/stream-dedup.md`](user_guide/channels-streams/stream-dedup.md) for the operator-facing workflow.

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/channel-merges/candidates` | Synchronous candidate lookup — find the best matching channel for an incoming stream name |
| `GET /api/channel-merges` | List pending (or resolved) merge rows, paginated |
| `GET /api/channel-merges/snapshot` | Read one coherent, bounded snapshot of the complete pending queue |
| `POST /api/channel-merges/{id}/accept` | Accept the dedup candidate — merge the stream into the candidate channel |
| `POST /api/channel-merges/{id}/dismiss` | Dismiss the dedup candidate — signal that a new channel should be created |

All endpoints require JWT Bearer token authentication. `GET /api/channel-merges` requires `RequireAuthIfEnabled`. The candidate lookup, complete snapshot, and `POST` mutation endpoints require `RequireAdminIfEnabled`.

---

### `GET /api/channel-merges/candidates`

Synchronous lookup: given an incoming stream name and optional group scope, returns the best matching candidate channel from Dispatcharr. Used by the interactive drag-drop and "Add Stream" surfaces to decide whether to show the dedup modal.

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `stream_name` | string | Yes | The incoming stream name to score against existing channels |
| `group_id` | integer | No | Dispatcharr group ID; restricts the candidate pool to channels in this group |
| `page` | integer | No | Page number (default: 1) |
| `page_size` | integer | No | Results per page (default: 50) |

ECM fetches channels from Dispatcharr, runs them through the dedup matcher with the operator-configured `dedup_threshold` (clamped to the ADR-008 §D2 hard floor of 60%), and returns the top-1 candidate or an empty list if no candidate meets the threshold.

**Response: `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "stream_name": "ESPN HD",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "channel_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-...",
      "channel_name": "ESPN",
      "confidence": 0.87
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 50,
  "total_pages": 1
}
```

`candidates` contains at most one entry — the best match above the threshold. An empty `candidates` list means no channel met the threshold; the caller should proceed with creating a new channel. Confidence is expressed as a decimal (0.0–1.0); the configured `dedup_threshold` is the minimum value that will appear.

**Metric emitted:** `ecm_dedup_candidate_lookup_duration_seconds` Histogram (SLO-10a).

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:6100/api/channel-merges/candidates?stream_name=ESPN+HD&group_id=12" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

---

### `GET /api/channel-merges`

Returns the paginated list of channel merge rows. Use the `status` query parameter to view the live queue (`pending`), accepted rows (`merged`), or dismissed rows (`dismissed`).

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `status` | string | No | Filter by row state: `pending` (default), `merged`, or `dismissed` |
| `group_id` | integer | No | Filter by Dispatcharr group ID |
| `page` | integer | No | Page number (default: 1) |
| `page_size` | integer | No | Results per page (default: 50) |

**Response: `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "stream_name": "ESPN HD",
      "group_id": 12,
      "candidate_channel_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-...",
      "confidence": 0.87,
      "status": "pending",
      "trigger_context": "m3u_refresh",
      "created_at": 1747497600000,
      "resolved_at": null,
      "resolution_source": null
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 50,
  "total_pages": 1
}
```

`trigger_context` is one of `drag_drop`, `add_stream`, `m3u_refresh`, `mcp_tool`. `created_at` and `resolved_at` are epoch milliseconds (UTC). Terminal-state rows (`merged`, `dismissed`) have `resolved_at` populated and `resolution_source` set to `operator`, `auto`, `bulk_m3u_hook`, or `mcp_tool`.

---

### `GET /api/channel-merges/snapshot`

Returns one deterministic snapshot of the complete `pending` queue for Select
all, selected Refresh, and queue-wide confirmation. The route is read-only but
**requires admin authorization** because it exposes the complete destructive
action target set. Optional `group_id` scopes the snapshot to pending records
in one channel group, matching the list endpoint's group filter. Clients must
forward the active list scope so a bulk action cannot target another group.

The database record set is read by one ordered query (`created_at DESC`,
`id DESC`). Candidate name, number, and group enrichment follows the paginated
list serializer; unresolved candidates retain their ID and return null
enrichment fields.

**Response: `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "merges": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "stream_name": "ESPN HD",
      "group_id": 12,
      "candidate_channel_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-...",
      "candidate_channel_name": "ESPN",
      "candidate_channel_number": 101,
      "candidate_channel_group_name": "Sports",
      "confidence": 0.87,
      "status": "pending",
      "trigger_context": "m3u_refresh",
      "created_at": 1747497600000,
      "resolved_at": null,
      "resolution_source": null
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

The safety ceiling is 20,000 pending records. If the queue exceeds it, ECM
returns **`409 Conflict`** with `detail` stating the limit and that nothing was
changed; it never returns a partial snapshot.

---

### `POST /api/channel-merges/{id}/accept`

Accept the dedup candidate: merge the incoming stream into the candidate channel in Dispatcharr. Writes an audit row to `pending_merge_journal` (ADR-008 §D6). The `id` is the `pending_merges.id` integer from the list endpoint.

**Authentication:** `RequireAdminIfEnabled`

**Path parameter:** `id` (integer) — the pending merge row ID.

**Request body:** none.

**Response: `200 OK`** — flat outcome envelope.

```json
{
  "merged_into_channel_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-...",
  "journal_entry_id": 307,
  "source_stream_id": "s9k2m1p7-...",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "status": "merged"
}
```

`source_stream_id` is the resolved Dispatcharr stream ID when the name lookup is unambiguous; falls back to the raw `stream_name` string when the lookup is ambiguous (audit-first contract per ADR-008 §D6). `journal_entry_id` is the `pending_merge_journal` row ID.

This endpoint is **idempotent** on the `merged` terminal state: calling `/accept` on a row already in `merged` returns `200` with the prior outcome envelope. Calling `/accept` on a `dismissed` row returns `409 INVALID_STATE`.

**Audit fields:** the `pending_merge_journal` row records `actor_token_id` (the JWT session's underlying API token ID), `action_type='merge_confirmed'`, `trigger_context` carried from the queue row, and `confidence_score` captured at action time.

**Error responses:**

| Status | Code | Description | When |
|-|-|-|-|
| 404 | `TARGET_NOT_FOUND` | Candidate channel no longer exists in Dispatcharr | The candidate channel was deleted after the pending row was queued; dismiss this row and re-run the original trigger |
| 409 | `INVALID_STATE` | Row is in a terminal state that cannot accept this transition | Calling `/accept` on a `dismissed` row |

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:6100/api/channel-merges/42/accept" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

---

### `POST /api/channel-merges/{id}/dismiss`

Dismiss the dedup candidate: signal that a new channel should be created for this stream. Writes an audit row to `pending_merge_journal`. Does not call Dispatcharr — this is a pure ECM-side state flip.

**Authentication:** `RequireAdminIfEnabled`

**Path parameter:** `id` (integer) — the pending merge row ID.

**Request body:** none.

**Response: `200 OK`** — flat outcome envelope.

```json
{
  "journal_entry_id": 308,
  "status": "dismissed"
}
```

This endpoint is **idempotent** on the `dismissed` terminal state: calling `/dismiss` on a row already in `dismissed` returns `200`. Calling `/dismiss` on a `merged` row returns `409 INVALID_STATE`.

**Error responses:**

| Status | Code | Description | When |
|-|-|-|-|
| 404 | Not Found | Row ID does not exist | Invalid or already-purged row ID |
| 409 | `INVALID_STATE` | Row is in a terminal state that cannot accept this transition | Calling `/dismiss` on a `merged` row |

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:6100/api/channel-merges/42/dismiss" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

---

### Error codes

| Code | HTTP status | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `TARGET_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | The candidate channel no longer exists in Dispatcharr. The operator path is to dismiss this pending merge row and re-run the original trigger (drag-drop, Add Stream, or M3U refresh) — the refreshed run will find a current candidate if one exists, or fall through to new-channel creation if none does. |
| `INVALID_STATE` | 409 | The row is already in a terminal state that makes the requested transition invalid: `/accept` on a `dismissed` row, or `/dismiss` on a `merged` row. Both terminal states are idempotent for their own action (accept-on-merged → 200 with prior envelope; dismiss-on-dismissed → 200). |

## Event Sync Reviews

The `/api/event-sync-reviews/*` family (bead ti939.3.2) is the review queue for ambiguous Event Sync matches — ambiguous-band scores and contested ties enqueue here instead of being silently skipped. Rows key on **content fingerprints** — `(rule_id, provider_id, stream_name_hash, event_key)` — never channel/stream IDs, so decisions survive Dispatcharr refreshes and re-apply on every future run. Feature guide: [`docs/event_sync.md`](event_sync.md) → "Reviewing ambiguous matches"; fingerprint semantics: `backend/services/event_sync_review.py`.

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/event-sync-reviews` | Paginated list. Query: `status` (`pending` default \| `accepted` \| `rejected` \| `superseded`), `rule_id`, `page`, `page_size` (≤200). Rows carry the fingerprint columns, state-machine fields, and a parsed display-only `evidence` snapshot (both raw names, parsed titles/starts, score/band/team-verdict/time-delta, snapshot ids). `RequireAuthIfEnabled`. |
| `POST /api/event-sync-reviews/{id}/accept` | Accept a pairing: records the durable fingerprint decision (future runs auto-attach it), supersedes sibling pending pairings for the same stream fingerprint, then best-effort attaches immediately — snapshot channel/stream ids are re-verified against live Dispatcharr (channel name must still parse to the row's `event_key`; stream name must still hash to `stream_name_hash`) and a failed verification defers the attach to the next run (`attach_deferred_reason`). Response: `{status: "accepted", attached, already_attached, attach_deferred_reason, superseded_siblings}`. Idempotent on `accepted`; `409` on `rejected`/`superseded`; `404` if missing. `RequireAdminIfEnabled`. |
| `POST /api/event-sync-reviews/{id}/reject` | Reject a pairing: durable fingerprint suppression — future runs neither attach nor re-ask. No Dispatcharr call. Response: `{status: "rejected"}`. Idempotent on `rejected`; `409` on `accepted`/`superseded`. `RequireAdminIfEnabled`. |

Audit: accepts/rejects write `journal_entries` rows (category `event_sync`, action `review_accept`/`review_reject`); an immediate attach writes the standard `merge_stream` entry with `after_value.match.attach_source = "review_queue"` (threshold attaches carry `"threshold"`), keeping queue-driven attaches distinguishable and covered by the journal-driven surgical unmerge.

---

## Event Sync Exclusions

The `/api/event-sync-exclusions/*` family (bead ti939.3.5) is the operator "never attach this pairing" surface — a durable standing order the shared resolver (`backend/services/event_sync_resolver.py`) filters out on **every** future run and preview, before the attach band is even honored. It closes the loop a stateless recompute otherwise can't: a false-positive attach the operator manually detaches would keep re-attaching on every subsequent run. Rows key on the same **content fingerprint** as review rows — `(rule_id, provider_id, stream_name_hash, event_key)` — never channel/stream IDs, so an exclusion survives Dispatcharr refreshes and stream-ID churn. An exclusion **outranks** a prior review-queue accept for the same fingerprint. Feature guide: [`docs/event_sync.md`](event_sync.md) → "Never-attach exclusions"; fingerprint semantics: `backend/services/event_sync_review.py`.

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/event-sync-exclusions` | Paginated list, newest first. Query: `rule_id` (optional filter), `page`, `page_size` (≤200, `400` if out of range). Rows carry the fingerprint columns plus a parsed display-only `evidence` snapshot. `RequireAuthIfEnabled`. |
| `POST /api/event-sync-exclusions` | Create a standing exclusion from the fingerprint components (body shape below). **Idempotent on the fingerprint** — a repeat POST for an already-excluded pairing returns the existing row (`already_existed: true`) rather than creating a duplicate, and refreshes the stored `note` if a new one is supplied. `404` if `rule_id` doesn't reference an existing rule. `RequireAdminIfEnabled`. |
| `DELETE /api/event-sync-exclusions/{id}` | Remove the standing order. The pairing becomes matchable again on the next run/preview — the delete itself re-attaches nothing (the idempotent run is the applier, same posture as a review-queue accept). `404` if the id doesn't exist. `RequireAdminIfEnabled`. |

### `POST /api/event-sync-exclusions` — fingerprint body shape

```json
{
  "rule_id": 12,
  "provider_id": 7,
  "stream_name_hash": "5f2c1a...e91a",
  "event_key": "mercury vs. aces|2026-07-11T22:00:00+00:00",
  "note": "Wrong venue, provider always mislabels this slot",
  "evidence": {
    "stream_name": "Peacock 14: Mercury vs. Aces @ 11 Jul 06:00 PM ET",
    "master_channel_name": "Mercury vs. Aces",
    "rule_name": "Live Events (multi-provider)",
    "provider": "Provider B"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `rule_id` | integer | Yes | The owning event_sync rule. Must reference an existing `ChannelPipelineRule` (`404` otherwise). |
| `provider_id` | integer (≥0) | Yes | The secondary stream's M3U account id — `0` is the documented unknown-provider sentinel. |
| `stream_name_hash` | string | Yes | SHA-256 hex of the secondary stream's LOCALS-cleaned raw name (`services.dedup_matcher.clean_name`) — copy verbatim from a review row or a preview candidate, never compute it client-side. |
| `event_key` | string | Yes | The master side's parsed event identity: `<LOCALS-cleaned parsed title>\|<parsed start as UTC ISO-8601>`. |
| `note` | string, ≤2000 chars | No | Free-text operator annotation ("why never"). |
| `evidence` | object | No | Display-only snapshot (raw names etc.) for the exclusions-list UI — never identity-authoritative, never re-verified against Dispatcharr. |

The four fingerprint fields are never derived from channel/stream IDs — they're supplied verbatim, exactly as they appear on a review-queue row (`GET /api/event-sync-reviews`) or a preview response's candidate context.

**Response: `200 OK`** — `EventSyncExclusionRecord`:

```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "rule_id": 12,
  "provider_id": 7,
  "stream_name_hash": "5f2c1a...e91a",
  "event_key": "mercury vs. aces|2026-07-11T22:00:00+00:00",
  "created_at": 1752278400000,
  "note": "Wrong venue, provider always mislabels this slot",
  "evidence": { "stream_name": "...", "master_channel_name": "...", "rule_name": "...", "provider": "..." },
  "already_existed": false
}
```

`GET /api/event-sync-exclusions` wraps rows in the standard paginated envelope: `{exclusions: [EventSyncExclusionRecord, ...], total, page, page_size, total_pages}`.

Audit: create/delete write `journal_entries` rows (category `event_sync`, action `exclusion_create` / `exclusion_delete`).

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:6100/api/event-sync-exclusions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rule_id": 12, "provider_id": 7, "stream_name_hash": "5f2c1a...e91a", "event_key": "mercury vs. aces|2026-07-11T22:00:00+00:00"}'
```

MCP mirror: `list_event_sync_exclusions` / `create_event_sync_exclusion` / `delete_event_sync_exclusion` (`mcp-server/tools/event_sync_exclusions.py`) — delete is two-step (`confirm=False` previews, `confirm=True` removes), mirroring other MCP delete tools.

## Logos

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/channels/logos` | List logos (paginated, searchable) |
| `GET /api/channels/logos/{id}` | Get a single logo |
| `POST /api/channels/logos` | Create logo from URL |
| `POST /api/channels/logos/upload` | Upload logo image file |
| `PATCH /api/channels/logos/{id}` | Update logo |
| `DELETE /api/channels/logos/{id}` | Delete logo |

## Streams

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/streams` | List streams (paginated, searchable, filterable) |
| `POST /api/streams/by-ids` | Get streams by specific IDs |
| `GET /api/stream-groups` | List stream groups with stream counts |

## M3U

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/m3u/accounts/{id}` | Get M3U account details |
| `GET /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/stream-metadata` | Get stream metadata (tvg-id mappings) |
| `POST /api/m3u/accounts` | Create M3U account |
| `PUT /api/m3u/accounts/{id}` | Update M3U account (full) |
| `PATCH /api/m3u/accounts/{id}` | Partially update M3U account |
| `DELETE /api/m3u/accounts/{id}` | Delete M3U account |
| `POST /api/m3u/upload` | Upload M3U file |
| `POST /api/m3u/refresh` | Refresh all active M3U accounts |
| `POST /api/m3u/refresh/{id}` | Refresh a single M3U account |
| `POST /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/refresh-vod` | Refresh VOD content (XtreamCodes) |
| `GET /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/filters` | List filters for an account |
| `POST /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/filters` | Create filter for an account |
| `PUT /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/filters/{fid}` | Update a filter |
| `DELETE /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/filters/{fid}` | Delete a filter |
| `GET /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/profiles/` | List profiles for an account |
| `POST /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/profiles/` | Create profile for an account |
| `GET /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/profiles/{pid}/` | Get a specific profile |
| `PATCH /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/profiles/{pid}/` | Update a profile |
| `DELETE /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/profiles/{pid}/` | Delete a profile |
| `PATCH /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/group-settings` | Update group settings for an account. Since GH #720 Part B this also performs downstream **channel-profile reconcile** for every edited group that carries a `custom_properties.channel_profile_ids` selection: the group's channels are made members of EXACTLY the selected profiles (subtractive, one bulk write per profile). Best-effort — a reconcile failure NEVER fails the PATCH. Guardrails: an absent/empty selection is a **no-op** (ECM stops managing that group's profiles and leaves memberships unchanged — never "disable everywhere"); a fully-stale selection (all selected profiles deleted) leaves channels untouched; a universe-fetch failure degrades to enable-only. Selection is **enforced globally per channel-group**: on save the selection is PROPAGATED (cascade-written) to every M3U account row carrying that channel-group so it takes effect regardless of which account it was made on. The primary write + sibling cascade are serialized under a per-effective-group lock **within the process** (single-operator assumption). When a TLS request subprocess is running it forwards exactly the lock-participating paths (this save's cascade, the single-account M3U refresh, the Channel Pipeline / Auto-Create run endpoints and their `/api/auto-creation` alias, and every background task run AND cancel) to the main process so main stays the sole writer of those paths; the forward imposes no timeout ceiling (main's request-timeout budget is authoritative, so a long task run is not cut to a false error). Direct channel-profile membership endpoints are NOT part of this forwarding (separate pre-existing concern — bead `nq3ed`). The cascade is a sequence of independent remote PATCHes (not one atomic transaction); an incomplete propagation is surfaced (named accounts) and the every-pass normalize converges non-empty divergence. **CLEAR ordering:** clearing a selection first reads a FRESH account list under the lock (if that read is unavailable, malformed, empty, or omits the account being edited the clear FAILS CLOSED with zero writes — never clears the authoritative primary on an unverified/incomplete enumeration, which could otherwise strand real siblings that resurrect the selection on the next sweep), then clears the sibling rows and the authoritative primary last — if any sibling clear fails the whole clear ABORTS before the primary is touched (prior selection preserved, no resurrection). A partial clear (some siblings cleared before one failed) reports the TRUTHFUL outcome: the 503 detail names both the cleared and the failed accounts, and the accounts that ACTUALLY changed are journaled so the operator can re-save to complete. A collapse resolves a defensive winner for legacy rows (precedence: `auto_channel_sync` ON, then a row that HAS a selection, then lowest `m3u_account_id`) and flags a residual conflict. Channels set by a Channel Pipeline `assign_channel_profile` rule are excluded until that rule is disabled/deleted (ownership handoff). **Response envelope:** a healthy/field-only save returns **200** with `ecm_profile_apply: [{status, group_id, failed_profile_ids, conflict, error, ...}]` per group (`status` ∈ `no_selection`, `no_channels`, `stale_selection`, `reconciled`, `partial_failure`, `degraded`, `error`) so the UI can warn on an incomplete apply. The two failure classes are distinct by status: a reconcile that fails AFTER the selection was safely written returns **200** with the warning in `ecm_profile_apply` (the save stuck; the sweep retries), whereas a **pre-write safety failure** — the group-settings fetch (lock key) was unavailable, or a CLEAR could not read a valid account list / aborted before the primary write — is NOT written and returns **HTTP 503** with `{detail: "…NOT saved…/…NOT fully cleared… retry"}` (naming affected accounts), so it never reads as success. Non-integer `channel_profile_ids` are rejected with **422**. |
| `POST /api/m3u/accounts/{id}/group-auto-sync-toggle` | Guided-setup toggle of ONE group's `auto_channel_sync` (bead ti939.3.4). Admin-gated; body `{channel_group_id, auto_channel_sync, confirm: true}` — `confirm: true` is REQUIRED (400 otherwise; the toggle is an explicit operator action, never a side effect).

### Guide migration

`POST /api/epg/migration/preview` accepts
`{"target_epg_source_id": 20}` and returns every channel classification, status
counts, and a five-minute signed `preview_token`. Only `ready` rows may be sent
to apply. A row is ready only when its LCN/station identifier resolves to
exactly one target EPG row.

`POST /api/epg/migration/apply` accepts the target source, preview token, and
the exact ready-row identities returned by preview. A valid request returns
`202 Accepted`:

```json
{
  "batch_id": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "status": "running",
  "total": 2,
  "poll_url": "/api/epg/migration/apply/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
}
```

`batch_id` is 128 random bits rendered as 32 lowercase hexadecimal characters.
Poll the supplied URL until `status` is `completed` or `failed`. Running and
terminal responses include `processed`, `total`, and a `result` envelope with
the current counters (`mutated`, `updated`, `audit_failed`, `skipped`,
`failed`) plus all per-channel results produced so far. Result statuses are
`updated`, `updated_audit_failed`, `ambiguous_target`, `unsupported_origin`,
`semantic_drift`, `changed_since_preview`, or `failed`.

The ECM dialog polls until a terminal response while it remains open; it does
not impose a client-side wall-clock cutoff. Closing the dialog aborts client
polling but does not cancel the accepted server job. Transient network and
server errors retain the known batch ID and last partial result and are
retried. A not-found poll can indicate a server restart; the dialog preserves
the batch ID and directs the operator to build a fresh preview and reconcile
the affected channels in Dispatcharr.

Only one migration apply may run at a time; another POST receives
`409 Conflict`. Invalid, expired, reordered, or tampered preview identities
also receive `409` and must be previewed again. Job polling state is
process-local, is never pruned while running, and is retained for 30 minutes
measured from terminal completion. Status reads also perform expiry cleanup.
Poll access is bound to the immutable provider-kind and numeric/synthetic ID of
the administrator who accepted the job (renaming a user does not break polling;
the static MCP principal has its stable synthetic ID; auth-disabled mode
intentionally treats operators as equivalent). Authorization is checked at
acceptance and polling, not continuously during execution. Batch IDs must be
exactly 32 lowercase hexadecimal characters. Malformed, expired, unknown, and
foreign-owned IDs all return the same not-found response.

The process-local envelope and active-job marker are lost on restart.
Dispatcharr PATCH and ECM Journal commit are separate operations: cancellation,
restart, an indeterminate HTTP response, or failure between PATCH and Journal
can leave a changed channel without a corresponding Journal row. After any
interruption, do not infer upstream state from the missing job or Journal
alone—build a fresh preview, verify affected channels directly in Dispatcharr,
and reconcile before retrying. Fatal polls intentionally contain only the
fixed `Guide migration failed.` message; detailed exceptions remain server-side.

Before any mutation, apply rebuilds one bounded source/target snapshot and
requires every signed target to remain the exact sole candidate. It then
refetches each current/target EPG row and channel immediately before PATCH.
Dispatcharr exposes neither a source-mapping revision nor compare-and-swap for
the channel update, so it cannot eliminate a non-migration writer changing
mapping state after the snapshot or the channel between the final GET and
PATCH. This accepted TOCTOU limitation is fail-closed wherever Dispatcharr
provides a revalidation point; rerun Preview after any skipped or uncertain
result.

## Event Sync Team Aliases

Operator team-alias dictionary for the Event Sync matcher's team-token layer (bead ti939.4.2): groups of known-equivalent team spellings (`Man Utd == Manchester United == MUFC`) that raise recall on abbreviation-heavy providers without lowering the fuzzy threshold. Stored as a JSON setting (no DB table); consulted on BOTH the team hard-reject and boost paths; strictly monotonic (an alias can never create a conflict). Aliases are corpus-gated by policy — see [`docs/event_sync.md`](event_sync.md) → "Team aliases (operator dictionary)".

| `PUT /api/event-sync/team-aliases` | Full-replace write. Validates each term against the matcher's own team normalization (≥2 terms per group, no blank/identity-free terms, a term may appear in only one group; ≤200 groups, ≤50 terms/group, ≤100 chars/term). Journals before/after under category `event_sync`. |

**Per-channel attribution fields**:

Each channel object — and each entry in `channel.clients[]` — carries
per-source attribution fields when an integration is enabled and the
session matches. Attribution is networking-agnostic (per-channel set
reconciliation, not an IP join); see
[Architecture § User Attribution Pipeline](architecture.md#user-attribution-pipeline)
for the model.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `emby_viewers` | `[{user_id, user_name}] \| null` | Emby users on this channel/client. At channel level: the full distinct set. At client level: that connection's assigned user(s) — one for a 1:1 match, or the full set for a server-proxy connection carrying multiple viewers. Null if Emby disabled or no match. |
| `plex_viewers` | `[{user_id, user_name}] \| null` | Plex users on this channel/client (same shape as `emby_viewers`). `user_id` is `null` for Plex — `/status/sessions` exposes no stable id. Null if Plex disabled or no match. |
| `jellyfin_viewers` | `[{user_id, user_name}] \| null` | Jellyfin users on this channel/client (same shape as `emby_viewers`). Null if Jellyfin disabled or no match. |
| `emby_user_name` | `string \| null` | Singular display name. Usually the assigned (or most-recent, at channel level) Emby user's name. For a connection in a genuinely-ambiguous group it is instead the Option-B rollup label `"N viewers: a, b, …"` (and `emby_viewers` is left empty for that client so the UI renders the label verbatim rather than confident names). Provided for back-compat; prefer `emby_viewers`. |
| `plex_user_name` | `string \| null` | Singular Plex display name (same semantics as `emby_user_name`, including the Option-B rollup label). Prefer `plex_viewers`. |
| `jellyfin_user_name` | `string \| null` | Singular Jellyfin display name (same semantics, including the Option-B rollup label). Prefer `jellyfin_viewers`. |
| `attribution_source` | `'emby' \| 'plex' \| 'jellyfin' \| 'dispatcharr' \| null` | The source that wins display precedence (Emby > Plex > Jellyfin > Dispatcharr). |

| `POST /api/normalization/test-batch` | Test all enabled rules against multiple texts |
| `POST /api/normalization/normalize` | Normalize text using all enabled rules |
| `POST /api/normalization/apply-to-channels` | Apply enabled rules to existing channels — admin-gated, rate-limited 5/minute, `dry_run=true` by default (see note below) |
| `GET /api/normalization/rule-stats` | Get stream match statistics per rule |
| `GET /api/normalization/lint-findings` | Read-only view of saved normalization rules that fail the current write-time linter (bd-eio04.7) |

| `POST /api/normalization/import` | Import normalization rules |
| `GET /api/normalization/migration/status` | Get migration status |
| `POST /api/normalization/migration/run` | Run demo rules migration |

`POST /api/normalization/apply-to-channels` computes a diff of "what would change if we applied the current rule set to every existing channel" and, in execute mode, renames or merges per-row according to the caller-supplied `actions[]` array. Guarantees:

- **Admin-gated** — protected by `RequireAdminIfEnabled`; non-admin callers see HTTP 403 when auth is enabled.
- **Rate-limited** — 5 requests/minute per remote address (slowapi) to prevent runaway bulk-apply loops.
- **Dry-run by default** — `dry_run=true` returns `{dry_run, diffs, channels_with_changes}` without mutating. `dry_run=false` requires an explicit `actions[]` body; unspecified channels default to `skip`.
- **Single-flight execute** — only one concurrent execute run is allowed; a second caller sees HTTP 409.
- **Journaled** — every rename and merge writes a journal entry with the `rule_set_hash` captured at execute time for audit and undo.

See [`docs/normalization.md` §Re-normalize existing channels](normalization.md#re-normalize-existing-channels) for the operator workflow.

## Tags

| Endpoint | Description |

## Stream Preview

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/stream-preview/{id}` | Preview a stream (proxy with optional transcoding) |
| `GET /api/channel-preview/{id}` | Preview a channel (proxy with optional transcoding) |

## Journal

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/journal` | Get journal entries (paginated, filterable) |
| `GET /api/journal/stats` | Get journal statistics |
| `DELETE /api/journal/purge` | Purge old journal entries |

`GET /api/journal` accepts `page` (>= 1), `page_size` (1-250), `category`, `action_type`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `search`, `user_initiated`, and `batch_id`. Out-of-range `page`/`page_size` values return `422` rather than being silently clamped or passed through. Each result row carries `batch_id` in the response body — bulk operations (e.g. `POST /api/channel-pipeline/rules/bulk-update`, channel renumber) write **N per-entity rows sharing one `batch_id`** so callers can stitch a forensic view of a single batch. The `batch_id` query parameter (added in bd-s4sph) is an exact-match filter that hits `idx_journal_batch_id` directly — pass the 8-character `batch_id` returned by a bulk handler to retrieve only that batch's rows. An unknown `batch_id` returns an empty result set (not `422`); the parameter is purely a filter. See the Channel Pipeline `bulk-update` notes above for a worked example.

## Notifications

| `DELETE /api/notifications` | Clear notifications (read only or all) |
| `DELETE /api/notifications/by-source` | Delete notifications by source |

## Alert Methods

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/alert-methods` | List all alert methods |
| `GET /api/alert-methods/types` | Get available alert method types |
| `POST /api/alert-methods` | Create alert method |
| `GET /api/alert-methods/{id}` | Get alert method details |
| `PATCH /api/alert-methods/{id}` | Update alert method |
| `DELETE /api/alert-methods/{id}` | Delete alert method |
| `POST /api/alert-methods/{id}/test` | Send test notification |

An **alert method** is one configured channel (Discord webhook, Telegram bot, SMTP recipient list) that ECM uses to notify operators about scheduled-task results, probe failures, M3U/EPG refresh outcomes, and other system events. Each method carries its own per-type `config` blob, four per-severity opt-in flags (`notify_info`, `notify_success`, `notify_warning`, `notify_error`), and an optional granular `alert_sources` filter for per-EPG-source / per-M3U-account routing. **`method_type` uniqueness is NOT enforced** — multiple SMTP methods (or multiple Discord webhooks) can coexist, each with its own recipient set, severity opt-ins, and source filter; this is intentional so operators can route different alert categories to different recipients without collapsing them onto one row.

`GET /api/alert-methods` returns an array of alert-method records. Each record carries:

```json
{
  "id": 7,
  "name": "Ops Email",
  "method_type": "smtp",
  "enabled": true,
  "config": { "to_emails": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"] },
  "notify_info": false,
  "notify_success": true,
  "notify_warning": true,
  "notify_error": true,
  "alert_sources": null,
  "last_sent_at": "2026-04-25T14:30:12Z",
  "created_at": "2026-04-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

`config` shape varies by `method_type`:
- **`discord`** — `{ "webhook_url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..." }`
- **`telegram`** — `{ "bot_token": "...", "chat_id": "..." }`
- **`smtp`** — `{ "to_emails": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"] }` (recipient list only — shared SMTP server settings live under `/api/settings`, see `smtp_*` fields)

`alert_sources` is either `null` (send for every event) or a structured filter object documented under the per-section keys `epg_refresh`, `m3u_refresh`, and `probe_failures` (each with `enabled`, `filter_mode` ∈ `{all, only_selected, all_except}`, and a per-section ID list or `min_failures` threshold).

`POST /api/alert-methods` accepts:

```json
{
  "name": "Ops Email",
  "method_type": "smtp",
  "config": { "to_emails": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"] },
  "enabled": true,
  "notify_info": false,
  "notify_success": true,
  "notify_warning": true,
  "notify_error": true,
  "alert_sources": null
}
```

`name`, `method_type`, and `config` are required; the four `notify_*` flags and `enabled` default per the table above; `alert_sources` defaults to `null` (send everything). The handler rejects unknown `method_type` values with `400`. Per-type `config` is run through that type's `validate_config()` — for SMTP, every entry in `to_emails` must pass an HTML5-style email regex and is rejected if it contains any of `\r \n < > :` (defense-in-depth against header injection at the SMTP sink, bd-6e8gv). The response is the abbreviated form `{ id, name, method_type, enabled }`; round-trip via `GET /api/alert-methods/{id}` for the full record.

**SMTP `to_emails` shape (bd-9vz32):** the canonical write shape is `list[str]`. The route accepts either `list[str]` or a legacy comma-joined `str` on POST/PATCH and normalizes string input to a list **before** persistence — so reads from rows written after bd-9vz32 always return `list[str]`. This is a **write-strict / read-tolerant** contract: pre-bd-9vz32 rows that were stored as a `str` continue to load (the SMTP runtime path coerces both shapes via `_coerce_to_emails_to_list`), so no Alembic migration is needed for the JSON-blob field. Writers should send `list[str]`; readers should expect `list[str]` for any row created or last-updated after bd-9vz32 and tolerate `str` for older rows.

`PATCH /api/alert-methods/{id}` is a partial update — every field on the body is `Optional`, and only fields present on the wire are touched. The common shape since PR #163 is **config-only** (e.g. `{"config": {"to_emails": [...]}}`), used by the Settings → Email Alerts panel to push recipient changes without re-sending the unchanged severity flags. The handler validates the same per-type `validate_config()` and applies the same SMTP `to_emails` canonicalization on PATCH as on POST. `404` if the method doesn't exist; `200` with `{"success": true}` on success.

`DELETE /api/alert-methods/{id}` removes the row and unloads the method from the in-memory `AlertMethodManager`. `404` if the method doesn't exist; `200` with `{"success": true}` on success. Deletion is unconditional — alerts in flight at deletion time are not buffered or re-routed.

`POST /api/alert-methods/{id}/test` invokes the method's `test_connection()` (Discord: posts a test webhook payload; Telegram: sends a test message to the configured chat; SMTP: sends a test email through the shared SMTP settings to the configured `to_emails`). Returns `{"success": <bool>, "message": <str>}` describing the outcome. `404` if the method doesn't exist; `200` with `success: false` if the method exists but the test failed (network error, bad credentials, SMTP not configured, etc.) — failed tests are **not** modeled as `5xx`.

`GET /api/alert-methods/types` returns the registry of available method types with their required and optional config fields:

```json
[
  { "type": "discord", "display_name": "Discord", "required_fields": ["webhook_url"], "optional_fields": {} },

  { "type": "smtp", "display_name": "Email", "required_fields": ["to_emails"], "optional_fields": {} }
]
```

The frontend uses this to drive the "add alert method" form so new method types appear automatically once registered server-side.

## Scheduled Tasks

## Channel Pipeline

> **Deprecated alias:** every endpoint below is also reachable at the old `/api/auto-creation/...` prefix. The alias forwards to the same handler and continues to work, but is hidden from the OpenAPI schema and should not be used in new integrations — use the canonical `/api/channel-pipeline/...` paths shown here.

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/channel-pipeline/rules` | List all rules sorted by priority |
| `GET /api/channel-pipeline/rules/{id}` | Get rule details |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/rules` | Create rule |
| `PUT /api/channel-pipeline/rules/{id}` | Update rule |
| `DELETE /api/channel-pipeline/rules/{id}` | Delete rule |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/rules/bulk-update` | Apply the same scalar field changes to multiple rules; rejects `conditions`/`actions` (see notes below) |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/rules/reorder` | Reorder rules by priority |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/rules/{id}/toggle` | Toggle rule enabled state |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/rules/{id}/duplicate` | Duplicate a rule |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/rules/{id}/run` | Run a single rule (supports dry_run) |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/run` | Run the full pipeline (execute or dry_run) |
| `GET /api/channel-pipeline/executions` | Get execution history (paginated) |
| `GET /api/channel-pipeline/executions/{id}` | Get execution details (optional log/entities) |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/executions/{id}/rollback` | Rollback an execution. With a pre-run snapshot it requires `confirm=true` (409 otherwise); once confirmed, an event_sync attach run whose journal fully covers its attaches is reverted SURGICALLY (only the run-added stream ids removed, post-run Dispatcharr churn preserved; response carries `surgical_unmerge: true`), otherwise it delegates to the full snapshot restore |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/validate` | Validate a rule definition |
| `GET /api/channel-pipeline/export/yaml` | Export all rules as YAML |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/import/yaml` | Import rules from YAML |
| `GET /api/channel-pipeline/schema/conditions` | Get available condition types |
| `GET /api/channel-pipeline/schema/actions` | Get available action types |
| `GET /api/channel-pipeline/schema/template-variables` | Get available template variables |
| `GET /api/channel-pipeline/lint-findings` | Read-only view of saved Channel Pipeline rules that fail the current write-time linter (bd-eio04.7) |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/rules/analyze` | Run the advisory rule analyzer over the rules currently in the DB; returns warnings only (saves are never blocked) |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/rules/analyze/from-bundle` | Run the analyzer over `rules.yaml` inside an uploaded debug-bundle `tar.gz`; never touches the DB, so it is safe for support diagnosis of any user's bundle. See `docs/channel_pipeline_rule_analyzer.md` |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/debug-bundle` | Start a diagnostic-bundle build; returns `{job_id, status: "running"}` immediately and dispatches a supervised background task |
| `GET /api/channel-pipeline/debug-bundle/{job_id}` | Poll a bundle build: JSON status while running, JSON `{status: "failed", error}` on failure, or the `tar.gz` (`application/gzip`) attachment when ready (obfuscated channels, rules, normalization rules, streams, probe stats, settings, task schedules, logs). Job is evicted on successful read; abandoned jobs pruned after 30 min |
| `GET /api/channel-pipeline/fuzzy-preview` | Paginated, write-free scored fuzzy match preview across given channel groups (bead jnzst, v0.17.3-0006). Admin-gated. See notes below. |
| `POST /api/channel-pipeline/event-sync-preview` | Event Sync dry-run: match secondary-group streams against live master channels with ZERO writes (bead ti939.1.4). Admin-gated. See notes below and `docs/event_sync.md`. |

---

### `GET /api/channel-pipeline/fuzzy-preview`

Returns scored `(stream, channel)` pairs for the given channel groups using the same backend scoring core and admission policy used by `merge_streams` rules with `loose_name_match + min_score`. Zero writes — inspection only.

**Authentication:** `RequireAdminIfEnabled` (admin token required when auth is enabled).

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `group_ids` | list of integers | Yes | — | Channel-group IDs to scope the preview to. Non-empty; no duplicates; no negatives; max 25 groups. An empty list is rejected (`400`). |
| `min_score` | float [0.0–1.0] | Yes | — | Minimum score to include a triple. May be below the `CONFIDENCE_FLOOR` (0.60) — the preview deliberately exposes sub-floor scores for inspection. An M1 callsign `conflict` is never returned regardless of `min_score`. |
| `allow_no_callsign` | boolean | No | `false` | Q1 opt-in. When `true`, a no-callsign (`"absent"`) pair is admissible at score ≥ 0.90 (`NO_CALLSIGN_FLOOR`). Default `false` requires a parseable callsign on both sides. |
| `page` | integer ≥ 1 | No | `1` | Page number. |
| `page_size` | integer 1–200 | No | `50` | Results per page. |

**DoS ceilings:** the N×M scoring pass is bounded. The endpoint processes at most 2,000 streams and 2,000 channels total across all requested groups. When a ceiling is hit the response includes `"truncated": true`.

**Response: `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "triples": [
    {
      "stream_id": 1042,
      "stream_name": "WI | WBAY CBS Green Bay HD",
      "channel_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-...",
      "channel_name": "WBAY",
      "score": 0.9412,
      "callsign_verdict": "match",
      "signal": "fuzzy-with-callsign"
    }
  ],
  "total": 47,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 50,
  "total_pages": 1,
  "min_score": 0.7,
  "truncated": false
}
```

Each `triples` entry is a `ScoredTriple`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `stream_id` | integer | ECM stream ID |
| `stream_name` | string | Raw stream name (not the LOCALS-cleaned form) |
| `channel_id` | string | Dispatcharr channel UUID |
| `channel_name` | string | Raw channel name (not the cleaned form) |
| `score` | float | Normalized score in [0.0, 1.0], rounded to 4 decimal places |
| `callsign_verdict` | string | `"match"` — both sides parsed a callsign and they agree; `"absent"` — at least one side had no parseable callsign |
| `signal` | string | Which scoring rung produced the score: `"callsign-exact"`, `"tvg_id-override"`, `"fuzzy-with-callsign"`, or `"fuzzy-no-callsign-floor"` |

Triples are sorted highest score first; ties break on `stream_id` then `channel_id` (deterministic).

**Admission policy.** The endpoint applies the shared `is_admissible` policy from `services.dedup_matcher`:

- `"conflict"` verdict (M1 callsign hard-reject) — never returned, even at `min_score == 0`.
- `"absent"` verdict — returned only when `allow_no_callsign=true` and `score >= 0.90`.
- `"match"` verdict — returned when `score >= min_score`.

This is the same policy the `merge_streams` rule executor applies, so the preview shows exactly what a rule would do.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "http://localhost:6100/api/channel-pipeline/fuzzy-preview?group_ids=14&group_ids=22&min_score=0.7&allow_no_callsign=false&page=1&page_size=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

### `POST /api/channel-pipeline/event-sync-preview`

Event Sync (epic ti939) dry-run: parses and scores every secondary-group stream against the master group's live channels using the exact resolver the attach path uses (`backend/services/event_sync_resolver.py` → `backend/services/event_sync_matcher.py`), so preview scoring and attach scoring cannot diverge. **Zero writes** — no merges, no channel mutations, and Dispatcharr group settings are never toggled. Feature guide: `docs/event_sync.md`.

**Authentication:** `RequireAdminIfEnabled` (admin token required when auth is enabled).

**Request body — exactly one of:**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-|-|-|
| `rule_id` | integer | Preview a saved event_sync rule (`404` if missing, `400` if the rule has no `event_sync_config`). |
| `event_sync_config` | object | Preview an inline config before saving (validated by the same `validate_event_sync_config` rail set as rule save; validation errors return `400` with teaching messages). |

**Response: `200 OK`** — a pre-flight failure does NOT fail the preview; the operator must see the misconfiguration alongside the match results.

| Key | Contents |
|-|-|
| `preflight` | `{ok, failures[]}` from the read-only group-settings check (master auto-sync ON, secondaries OFF, groups exist). |
| `summary` | `secondary_streams`, `would_attach`, `ambiguous_skipped`, `unmatched`, `parse_failed` (the four dispositions sum to `secondary_streams` and reconcile exactly with `streams`), plus `master_channels` / `master_channels_unparsed`, plus the ti939.3.2 review-queue context: `would_attach_via_review` (subset of `would_attach` reached via a prior review accept) and `candidates_pending_review` (rendered candidate pairings currently awaiting review). |
| `streams` | One row per secondary stream: raw name, provider, group, parsed title + start, disposition, `ambiguous_reason` (`contested_top_candidates` — the ti939.2.1 contested rail — or `top_candidate_ambiguous_band`; `null` otherwise), `attach_source` (`"threshold"` \| `"review_queue"` when the disposition is `would_attach`, else `null` — ti939.3.2), `would_attach_master` (name + current channel id, re-resolved this call), and up to 10 scored candidates (master name/id, parsed title/start, score, band, team-token verdict, time delta, machine-readable reject reason, and `review_status` — `pending`/`accepted`/`rejected`/`null` queue marker for that exact pairing, populated only when previewing a saved rule). |
| `unmatched_streams` | Streams with no master in the time window (the master-as-ceiling visibility hedge). On promotion-enabled configs (bead ti939.4.1) each row is annotated with `would_promote`, `promote_action` (`create` \| `attach_existing`), `promote_channel_name`, and `promote_capped`. A row the promotion filters dropped also carries the reason: `promote_skipped_past` (+ `promote_skipped_past_adopted` when that event already has a channel), `promote_skipped_early`, `promote_stream_dead`, or `promote_stream_dead` + `promote_skipped_all_dead` when every stream behind the event failed. |
| `parse_failures` | Failures grouped by `(group, reason)` with counts and sample names — a silently broken pattern is loud here. |
| `unparsed_master_channels` | Master channel names with no complete parsed identity (they can never be attach targets). |
| `truncated` | `true` when the fetch ceilings (2,000 streams / 2,000 channels) were hit. |
| `promotion` | **Present ONLY when the config carries `promote_unmatched: true`** (bead ti939.4.1 — absent otherwise, and `summary` then also carries `would_promote` / `would_promote_streams`): the promotion plan `{enabled, target_group_id, would_promote, would_promote_streams, would_create, would_attach_existing, cap, capped, cap_overage, skipped_past, skipped_past_adopted, skipped_early, dead_streams_skipped, skipped_all_dead, units[]}` where each unit is `{channel_name, action, event_key, dateless, existing_channel_id, streams[]}`. `skipped_past` counts the events `skip_past_events` dropped as already finished; `skipped_past_adopted` is the subset of those that already have a channel, which therefore leaves the rule's managed set for `orphan_action` to act on. `skipped_early` counts the events `promote_lead_hours` held back as still too far away (creates only, so an event that already has a channel is never held back). `dead_streams_skipped` counts individual streams `skip_dead_streams` left out, and `skipped_all_dead` counts events that lost every stream to it; neither ever removes a channel that already exists. The health check is the LAST gate, so both counts are relative to the events that survived the past filter, the lead window and the cap, never to the whole playlist, and an event that loses every stream has already spent its cap slot. The preview reads existing stream health and never probes, because a probe writes, so a live run probes first and the two can differ on a rule whose streams have never been probed. Every other number is computed by the SAME planner a live run executes (`services/event_sync_promote.py`), so preview equals run on unchanged data. See `docs/event_sync.md` → "Promoting unmatched events". |

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:6100/api/channel-pipeline/event-sync-preview" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_sync_config": {"master_group_id": 12, "secondary_group_ids": [34, 56]}}'
```

MCP mirror: the `preview_event_sync` tool (`mcp-server/tools/channel_pipeline.py`) wraps this endpoint for headless use.

---

`POST /api/channel-pipeline/rules/bulk-update` applies the same partial update to every rule in `rule_ids` in a single transaction. Send only the fields you want to change; omitted fields are left as-is per rule.

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "rule_ids": [12, 14, 17],
  "enabled": true,
  "priority": 5,
  "merge_streams_remove_non_matching": true
}
```

- `rule_ids` (required) — `1..500` distinct rule IDs. Empty list, missing list, or duplicates return `400`.
- Scalar fields accepted (any subset): `name`, `description`, `enabled`, `priority`, `m3u_account_id`, `target_group_id`, `run_on_refresh`, `stop_on_first_match`, `sort_field`, `sort_order`, `probe_on_sort`, `sort_regex`, `stream_sort_field`, `stream_sort_order`, `quality_tie_break_order`, `quality_m3u_tie_break_enabled`, `normalization_group_ids`, `skip_struck_streams`, `orphan_action`, `match_scope_target_group`.
- `merge_streams_remove_non_matching` (bulk-only convenience field) — when set, every `merge_streams` action on every targeted rule is rewritten with this `remove_non_matching` flag. Rules with no `merge_streams` action are unaffected.
- **Rejected fields (`422 Unprocessable Entity`):** `conditions`, `actions`. Per-rule logic edits must go through `PUT /api/channel-pipeline/rules/{id}` so silent payload drops can't lose intent at scale (bd-gjoe5). The error message names the offending field.
- At least one mutating field is required alongside `rule_ids`; otherwise `400 "No fields to update"`.
- If any `rule_ids` entry doesn't exist, the entire batch aborts with `404 "Rules not found: [...]"` and no rows are written.
- `sort_regex` is run through the Channel Pipeline regex linter before any DB work (bd-eio04.7); a failing pattern returns `400` with the linter findings.

**Response: `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "rules": [
    { "id": 12, "name": "...", "enabled": true, "priority": 5, "...": "..." },
    { "id": 14, "name": "...", "enabled": true, "priority": 5, "...": "..." },
    { "id": 17, "name": "...", "enabled": true, "priority": 5, "...": "..." }
  ],
  "updated_count": 3
}
```

`rules` is the full post-update `to_dict()` for every rule in `rule_ids` (in input order), built directly from the in-memory ORM instances after `commit()` — no per-rule round-trip. `updated_count` always equals `len(rule_ids)` on success, including rules where the requested values matched the current state (no-op rules are still returned but do not emit a journal entry — see below).

**Performance contract (bd-bh1hh):** the handler issues a single `SELECT ... WHERE id IN (rule_ids)` rather than N per-id queries, and skips per-rule `session.refresh()` after commit because the affected scalar columns have no DB-side defaults or triggers. At `max_length=500` this collapses what was previously ~1000 round trips into 2 (1 SELECT + 1 commit).

**Audit trail / `batch_id` correlation contract (bd-91mcq):** every bulk-update writes **N per-entity journal rows** — one row per rule whose state actually changed — all sharing a single 8-character `batch_id` (UUID4 prefix). Rules where no scalar column changed and `merge_streams_remove_non_matching` was either omitted or already at the requested value are skipped (no-op rules emit no journal row). Each row uses `category="auto_creation"`, `action_type="bulk_update"`, and carries the per-rule before/after diff in `before_value`/`after_value`.

To reconstruct one batch:

- **Preferred:** call `GET /api/journal?batch_id=<id>` (added in bd-s4sph). The handler applies an exact-match filter against `JournalEntry.batch_id`, hitting `idx_journal_batch_id` (added in bd-dmu8w) for an indexed lookup. The response is the standard paginated journal payload — every row will carry the same `batch_id`. An unknown `batch_id` returns an empty result set (not `422`); the parameter is purely a filter.
- For ad-hoc forensic queries directly against the database, the same index is reachable from SQL:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, timestamp, entity_id, entity_name, before_value, after_value
  FROM journal_entries
  WHERE batch_id = '1a2b3c4d'
  ORDER BY timestamp;
  ```
- Every journal row returned by `GET /api/journal` already includes `batch_id` in its body, so client-side grouping by `batch_id` from a broader query is also supported (pagination caveats apply on large windows).
- The `search` parameter does an `ILIKE %term%` on `entity_name` and `description` and can complement `batch_id` (e.g., narrow a batch to rules whose name matches a substring) — the two filters compose with `AND` semantics.

**Normalization interaction:** `normalization_group_ids` is an accepted scalar field, so bulk-update can reassign normalization groups across many rules in one call. The list is stored as-is (deduplicated and sorted) — IDs are **not** verified against `NormalizationRuleGroup` at write time, matching the behavior of `PUT /api/channel-pipeline/rules/{id}`. See [`docs/normalization.md`](normalization.md) for the full normalization model and how groups feed the Channel Pipeline.

| `POST /api/cron/validate` | Validate a cron expression |

## Dummy EPG

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `GET /api/dummy-epg/profiles` | List dummy EPG profiles |
| `POST /api/dummy-epg/profiles` | Create dummy EPG profile |
| `GET /api/dummy-epg/profiles/{id}` | Get dummy EPG profile |
| `PATCH /api/dummy-epg/profiles/{id}` | Update dummy EPG profile |
| `DELETE /api/dummy-epg/profiles/{id}` | Delete dummy EPG profile |
| `POST /api/dummy-epg/generate` | Generate dummy EPG data |
| `POST /api/dummy-epg/preview` | Preview dummy EPG output |
| `POST /api/dummy-epg/preview/batch` | Batch preview dummy EPG (zero-write). Each result also carries `event_sync_start_valid` — true only when the Event Sync matcher would build a real start time from the captured groups (valid month, hour ≤ 23, real calendar date; never guessed) |
| `GET /api/dummy-epg/xmltv` | Get combined XMLTV output |
| `GET /api/dummy-epg/xmltv/{id}` | Get XMLTV output for a profile |

`POST /api/dummy-epg/preview` accepts the full profile config plus:

- `inline_lookups: {<name>: {<key>: <value>, ...}, ...}` — per-source lookup tables referenced by `{key|lookup:<name>}`. Inline tables override globals of the same name.
- `global_lookup_ids: [id, ...]` — IDs of saved tables from `/api/lookup-tables`.
- `include_trace: bool` — when true, the response carries a `traces` dict keyed by template field (`title_template`, `description_template`, …). Trace entries describe literals, placeholders (with per-pipe input/output and lookup hit/miss), and conditionals (taken/skipped + branch kind).

## Lookup Tables

| `GET /api/lookup-tables/{id}` | Get a single table with full `entries` dict |
| `PATCH /api/lookup-tables/{id}` | Rename, edit description, and/or replace entries |
| `DELETE /api/lookup-tables/{id}` | Delete a table (cascades to any source still referencing it by ID — the preview path skips missing IDs silently) |

Names are unique. Each table is capped at 10 000 entries.

## Backup & Restore

The Backup & Restore subsystem (v0.18.0, ADR-012) exposes two tiers of endpoints: the **DBAS artifact** path (new-format v0.18.0, full 12-category round-trip) and the **legacy ZIP/YAML** path (pre-v0.18.0, ECM-config-only). All endpoints require admin authentication unless noted.

### DBAS artifact endpoints (v0.18.0+)

These endpoints operate on the new-format `.zip` artifacts produced by the `dbas_backup` task. They cover the full 12-category Dispatcharr + ECM configuration.

| Endpoint | Description |
|-|-|
| `POST /api/backup/restore-dbas` | Upload and restore a DBAS artifact (streaming, max 2 GiB). Validates integrity, schema version, and decompression-bomb checks before any mutation. Runs a **dry-run by default** (`confirm_apply=false`); pass `confirm_apply=true` to apply. Returns a `RestoreReport` with per-category `created/updated/skipped/failed` counts and `outcome` (tri-state: `success`, `partial_failed_rolled_back`, `failed_rollback_incomplete`). |
| `POST /api/backup/restore-dbas-saved` | Restore a saved DBAS artifact by filename (artifact must be in `/config/backups/`). Same dry-run/apply semantics as `/restore-dbas`. The saved file is not deleted. |
| `GET /api/backup/saved` | List saved DBAS backup artifacts under `/config/backups/`. Returns filename, size, and creation time. |
| `GET /api/backup/saved/{filename}` | Download a saved backup artifact (streamed). |
| `DELETE /api/backup/saved/{filename}` | Delete a saved backup artifact. |

#### Key restore parameters (`POST /api/backup/restore-dbas`)

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `file` | multipart file | required | The `.zip` backup artifact (plain or encrypted). |
| `confirm_apply` | bool | `false` | Set `true` to apply mutations. `false` (default) runs a counts-only dry-run; no changes are made. |
| `passphrase` | string | — | Required when the artifact is encrypted (detected from the file header). **Never logged or echoed.** |
| `selected_categories` | string (JSON array) | all categories | Comma-separated or JSON list of category keys to restore (e.g. `["m3u_accounts","channels"]`). Omit to restore all. |

#### RestoreReport response shape

```json
{
  "is_dry_run": true,
  "outcome": null,
  "categories": [
    {
      "entity_type": "m3u_account",
      "created": 0, "updated": 0, "skipped": 0, "failed": 0,
      "would_create": 3, "would_update": 0, "would_skip": 1,
      "skip_details": [
        { "reason": "already_exists_identical", "label": "My Provider", "source_export_id": 42 }
      ],
      "failure_details": []
    }
  ],
  "logo_misses": 0,
  "started_at": "2026-06-28T12:00:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2026-06-28T12:00:05Z",
  "notes": ["apply not confirmed — produced a counts-only dry-run; no mutation performed."]
}
```

- `is_dry_run: true` → `would_*` counts are populated; `created/updated/skipped/failed` are zero.
- `is_dry_run: false` → `created/updated/skipped/failed` counts are populated.
- `outcome` is `null` on a dry-run (a plan has no realized outcome). On an apply: `success`, `partial_failed_rolled_back`, or `failed_rollback_incomplete`.
- `logo_misses` is an aggregate count of logos that could not be matched or applied.

#### Error responses

| Status | Detail | When |
|-|-|-|
| 400 | `"Unsupported backup version"` | Artifact `schema_version` is newer than this ECM build supports. |
| 400 | `"Backup integrity check failed"` | A member's SHA-256 does not match the manifest. |
| 400 | `"Backup archive rejected"` | Decompression-bomb check failed (too many entries, too high a ratio, or excessive uncompressed size). |
| 400 | `"Not a valid ECM backup artifact"` | The artifact is missing `manifest.json`. |
| 400 | `"Could not decrypt artifact: wrong passphrase or corrupted artifact"` | Passphrase is wrong, or the encrypted artifact is corrupted. The same message is returned for both cases (no oracle). |

### Legacy ZIP/YAML endpoints (pre-v0.18.0 compatibility)

These endpoints operate on the pre-v0.18.0 format (ECM settings + `journal.db` only, no full Dispatcharr configuration round-trip). They remain available for compatibility and are used by the legacy restore-on-first-run wizard.

**Supported provider types in v0.18.0:** `s3` (AWS S3, MinIO, Backblaze B2), `gdrive` (Google Drive), `webdav`. Adapters for `onedrive` and `dropbox` exist in the codebase but are deferred — a configured target of a deferred provider type produces a per-target failure on each backup run.

See the [user guide](user_guide/backup-restore/configure-cloud-destinations.md) for per-provider credential fields.
