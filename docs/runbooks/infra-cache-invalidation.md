# Runbook: Infrastructure-Side Cache Invalidation (nginx / Cloudflare / Varnish / Generic CDN)

> Companion to [Dep-Bump Frontend Regression](./dep-bump-frontend-regression.md).
> That runbook covers browser-side invalidation (hard reload, service-worker
> flush). This one covers the layer in front of ECM: reverse proxies and
> CDNs, where a stale cached `index.html` or `/assets/*` chunk can mask a
> successful server-side deploy and leave users on a broken bundle.

- **Severity**: P2 (degraded UX, not a server outage). Promotes to P1 if it co-occurs with a frontend regression and blocks rollback verification.
- **Owner**: SRE (this runbook); Operator (performs flush against their own infra: Cloudflare/nginx/Varnish are typically outside the ECM container).
- **Last reviewed**: 2026-04-24
- **Related beads**: `enhancedchannelmanager-11t6c` (this runbook), `enhancedchannelmanager-pm1t4` (browser-side companion).

## When to use this runbook

Run this **after any frontend release** (any deploy that changes `/app/static/*`) **if** ECM is fronted by a reverse proxy or CDN that caches responses. Common shapes:

- **nginx / Apache / Caddy / Traefik** in front of ECM, with any form of response caching (`proxy_cache`, `fastcgi_cache`, edge caching modules).
- **Cloudflare** with Cache Rules, Page Rules, or the default "cache static content" behavior.
- **Varnish** in front of ECM.
- **Commercial CDNs** (Fastly, Akamai, CloudFront, Bunny.net, etc.) with edge caching enabled.
- **Corporate / ISP transparent proxies**: rarer, but seen in enterprise deploys; harder to invalidate.

Do **not** run this runbook if:

- The deploy did not change frontend assets (backend-only change, config change, env var bump).
- ECM is reached directly (browser → ECM) with nothing in between: the [browser-cache runbook](./dep-bump-frontend-regression.md#4-browser-cache-verification-is-the-user-on-the-rolled-back-bundle) is sufficient.

## Why infra-side caches matter

ECM's frontend deploy is a two-step atomic swap:

1. Clean stale chunks: `docker exec ecm-ecm-1 sh -c 'rm -rf /app/static/assets/*'`
2. Copy fresh bundle: `docker cp dist/. ecm-ecm-1:/app/static/`

After step 2, the container serves a new `index.html` pointing at new
content-hashed chunks (e.g. `/assets/index-abc12345.js`). The previous
chunks with their old hashes are gone from disk. This is correct by design:
Vite's default asset-hash strategy (see [`frontend/vite.config.ts`](../../frontend/vite.config.ts) and
[Vite build options](https://vite.dev/config/build-options)) means every
code change produces a new hashed filename, so the browser can cache
`/assets/*` forever safely. The only file that must not be cached is
`index.html`, which is the pointer to the current hashes.

What breaks this model:

- **A reverse proxy caches `/index.html` or `/`**: users continue to fetch
  the old `index.html`, which points at `/assets/index-<old-hash>.js`.
  That hash is gone from disk; they get a 404 and a blank page.
- **A CDN caches the root path** with a long TTL: same failure, at a wider
  blast radius.
- **A proxy caches `/assets/*` but serves from a stale origin snapshot**:
  users get the new `index.html` pointing at `/assets/index-<new-hash>.js`,
  but the proxy has a cached response for that path from a different origin
  deploy and serves the wrong bytes.

Browser-side invalidation (per the [Dep-Bump Frontend Regression runbook](./dep-bump-frontend-regression.md#forced-cache-invalidation-operator-side)) will not help here. The browser dutifully re-requests `index.html`, the proxy serves the stale copy, and the user sees the same broken bundle they saw before they hit `Ctrl+Shift+R`.

### What ECM emits today

- ECM serves static assets via FastAPI's [`StaticFiles`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/staticfiles/) mount (`backend/main.py`, `/assets` and the SPA fallback).
- **ECM ships cache-safe `Cache-Control` defaults** (bd-hl603):
  - `/assets/*` → `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`: Vite's content-hashed filenames make each path eternal-cache-safe.
  - `/` and the SPA fallback (which serves `index.html`) → `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate`: the entry-point HTML must always be revalidated so a fresh deploy's bundle URLs are picked up.
- The headers above ride on top of Starlette's default `ETag` + `Last-Modified`. A correctly-configured downstream cache will honor them and you will not need this runbook for routine deploys. **This runbook still matters when** a reverse proxy or CDN strips, overrides, or pre-dates these headers, which is common with default Cloudflare configurations, nginx `proxy_cache` blocks that ignore origin `Cache-Control`, or any cache that was warmed before the bd-hl603 release.
- **ECM ships no service worker.** Confirmed in `frontend/vite.config.ts` (no `vite-plugin-pwa`, no `workbox-*`). Any service-worker-induced caching seen in the wild is either a reverse proxy injecting one or a stale SW from a much older ECM build. Treat as anomalous.

Operators whose proxy ignores upstream `Cache-Control` (or who want belt-and-suspenders consistency at the edge) can apply the same policy at the proxy itself: `Cache-Control: no-cache` on `/` and `/index.html`, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` on `/assets/*`. See the per-proxy sections below for copy-pasteable snippets.

## Diagnosis

### 1. Confirm the server-side bundle is correct

Same step as the [browser-cache runbook](./dep-bump-frontend-regression.md#1-confirm-the-deployed-bundle-is-the-suspect):

```bash
docker exec ecm-ecm-1 grep -oE '/assets/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.(js|css)' /app/static/index.html | sort -u
```

Save this list: call it `SERVER_HASHES`. This is what the infrastructure **should** be delivering.

### 2. Fetch `index.html` through every hop

Go outside-in: from the furthest-out cache (CDN edge) toward ECM. At each hop, compare the hashes in the response body to `SERVER_HASHES`.

```bash
# Replace <public-host> with the operator's public hostname — Cloudflare / CDN edge will answer here.
curl -sS https://<public-host>/ | grep -oE '/assets/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.(js|css)' | sort -u

# If you can reach the origin directly (nginx/Varnish on the host OS, or the
# reverse proxy's "origin" / "upstream" URL), repeat against that host:
curl -sS http://<origin-host>:<origin-port>/ | grep -oE '/assets/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.(js|css)' | sort -u

# Inside the container (ground truth):
# `urlopen` raises HTTPError on any non-2xx, so catch it: a degraded ECM still
# serves index.html and still has to tell you which bundle it is serving.
docker exec ecm-ecm-1 python3 -c "
import os, urllib.error, urllib.request
port = os.environ.get('ECM_PORT', '6100')
try:
    response = urllib.request.urlopen(f'http://localhost:{port}/', timeout=5)
except urllib.error.HTTPError as error:
    response = error
print(response.read().decode())
" | grep -oE '/assets/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.(js|css)' | sort -u
```

Decision tree:

- **All three match `SERVER_HASHES`** → infra is not caching `index.html`. If users still hit a stale bundle, check their browser (run the [browser-cache runbook](./dep-bump-frontend-regression.md#4-browser-cache-verification-is-the-user-on-the-rolled-back-bundle)).
- **CDN edge differs, origin matches** → CDN is holding a stale `index.html`. Go to the Cloudflare / CDN section.
- **Origin host differs, container matches** → reverse proxy (nginx/Varnish/etc.) is holding it. Go to the matching proxy section.
- **Container differs from what you just deployed** → not a cache problem; the server-side deploy didn't take. Re-run the deploy steps and verify `ls -la /app/static/assets/` shows fresh mtimes.

### 3. Inspect cache headers

`curl -I` tells you which hop answered. The relevant headers differ by proxy, but the pattern is the same: look for any header that identifies the cache layer and its HIT/MISS/AGE status.

```bash
curl -sSI https://<public-host>/
```

| Header | Emitted by | What to read |
|-|-|-|
| `Age: <seconds>` | Generic HTTP caches (RFC 9111) | Non-zero `Age` on `/` means some cache is serving from storage, not asking the origin. |
| `CF-Cache-Status: HIT / MISS / DYNAMIC / REVALIDATED / EXPIRED / BYPASS` | Cloudflare | `HIT` on `/` after a deploy is the bug. `DYNAMIC` or `BYPASS` means Cloudflare is not caching, which is good. See [Cloudflare Cache Status docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/default-cache-behavior/#cloudflare-cache-responses). |
| `X-Cache: HIT / MISS` | Varnish (default), CloudFront, many CDNs | `HIT` on `/` after a deploy is the bug. |
| `X-Cache-Status: HIT / MISS / BYPASS / EXPIRED / STALE / UPDATING / REVALIDATED` | nginx `proxy_cache` (`add_header X-Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status`) | Same semantics. See [nginx `$upstream_cache_status`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#var_upstream_cache_status). |
| `X-Served-By` / `X-Varnish` | Varnish | Presence confirms Varnish is in the path. `X-Varnish: <xid1> <xid2>` (two IDs) indicates a cache hit. |
| `Via: 1.1 varnish` / `Via: 1.1 cloudfront` | Varnish / CloudFront | Identifies the cache vendor in the path. |
| `Cache-Control` | Whatever hop last set it | If absent on `/`, downstream caches apply heuristics: often "cache for 10 minutes" or worse. |
| `ETag` / `Last-Modified` | ECM (via Starlette `StaticFiles`) | Present on direct-from-container responses; proxies may strip them. |

Capture the full header dump to `/tmp/` for the incident record:

```bash
curl -sSI https://<public-host>/ > /tmp/ecm-infra-cache-headers.txt
```

## Resolution

Use the section that matches your infra. The principle is the same everywhere: **purge `/` and `/index.html` first.** Those two URLs are the pointers. Hashed `/assets/*` URLs are content-addressed and safe to leave alone; they will naturally age out. A blanket "purge everything" is fine but wasteful.

### nginx (`proxy_cache`)

Reference: [ngx_http_proxy_module: `proxy_cache`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache), [`proxy_cache_bypass`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_bypass), [`proxy_cache_purge`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_purge) (the last is commercial nginx Plus).

Open-source nginx has no built-in purge endpoint. Options, in order of preference:

**Option A: Scoped delete from the cache directory (open-source nginx):**

```bash
# Find your cache root (grep for `proxy_cache_path` in nginx.conf).
grep -r 'proxy_cache_path' /etc/nginx/

# Example — cache root at /var/cache/nginx, key format "$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri":
# Compute the MD5 of the cache key for "/". The key format is declared by
# `proxy_cache_key` in your config — use whatever the config says, not this example blindly.
KEY="httpsGEThttps://<public-host>/"
HASH=$(echo -n "$KEY" | md5sum | awk '{print $1}')
LEVEL1="${HASH:31:1}"
LEVEL2="${HASH:29:2}"

# Delete the cache entry for / and /index.html only:
rm -f /var/cache/nginx/${LEVEL1}/${LEVEL2}/${HASH}

# Or, the nuclear option — wipe the whole proxy cache:
find /var/cache/nginx -type f -delete
nginx -s reload   # reload only if your build uses `proxy_cache_use_stale` with `updating`
```

**Option B: `proxy_cache_bypass` on the next request:**

Add a config block that bypasses the cache when a specific header or query parameter is present, then hit the site once with that header. On hit, nginx re-validates against the origin and overwrites the cached entry.

```nginx
# In the server {} block:
proxy_cache_bypass $http_x_purge_cache;
```

```bash
curl -sSI -H "X-Purge-Cache: 1" https://<public-host>/
# The response should show X-Cache-Status: BYPASS. A subsequent request without
# the header should show MISS → HIT with the new content.
```

**Option C: Recommended config going forward:** exclude `/` and `/index.html` from caching entirely:

```nginx
location = / {
    proxy_pass http://ecm_upstream;
    proxy_cache_bypass 1;
    proxy_no_cache 1;
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" always;
}

location = /index.html {
    proxy_pass http://ecm_upstream;
    proxy_cache_bypass 1;
    proxy_no_cache 1;
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" always;
}

location /assets/ {
    proxy_pass http://ecm_upstream;
    proxy_cache ecm_cache;
    proxy_cache_valid 200 30d;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable" always;
    add_header X-Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status always;
}
```

This moves the problem upstream: hashed assets cache forever (safe), pointers never cache (safe). After this config, future releases do not need a purge step.

### Cloudflare

Reference: [Cloudflare Cache Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/), [Purge cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/purge-cache/).

**Dashboard: purge by URL (preferred; surgical):**

1. Log in → select the zone.
2. Caching → Configuration → **Purge Cache** → **Custom Purge**.
3. URL: enter both:
   - `https://<public-host>/`
   - `https://<public-host>/index.html`
4. Purge.

**Dashboard: purge everything (wasteful but fast):**

Caching → Configuration → Purge Cache → **Purge Everything**. Do this only if custom purge does not resolve within a minute or two, or if you cannot identify the exact URLs.

**API: purge by URL:**

```bash
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/zone-purge
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID}/purge_cache" \
  -d '{"files":["https://<public-host>/","https://<public-host>/index.html"]}'
# Expected: {"success":true,...}
```

**API: purge by prefix (Enterprise plan; check your plan):**

```bash
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID}/purge_cache" \
  -d '{"prefixes":["<public-host>/"]}'
```

**Recommended config going forward:** create a Cache Rule that bypasses cache for `/` and `/index.html` and sets a long edge TTL for `/assets/*`. Cloudflare's default "cache static content" is usually fine for the hashed assets, but the default may or may not cache `/` depending on your plan. A Cache Rule removes the ambiguity. See [Create a Cache Rule in the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/create-dashboard/).

### Varnish

Reference: [Varnish HTTP purge](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/purging.html), [vcl `ban`](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/reference/vcl-built-in-subs.html#vcl-recv).

Varnish distinguishes three invalidation methods. Pick the right one:

| Method | What it does | When to use |
|-|-|-|
| **Purge** | Removes one exact object from cache; next request re-fetches from backend. | Known URL, single object: this is the common case for `/` and `/index.html`. |
| **Ban** | Adds a predicate (regex); future lookups matching it miss until the ban lurker evicts them. | Wildcard invalidation, e.g. all `/assets/*`. Use sparingly. Bans accumulate. |
| **Refresh** (aka "force refresh") | Re-validates the cached object against the backend on the next request. | You want to keep old content as a fallback during revalidation; rarely needed for a deploy. |

For a frontend deploy you almost always want **purge**, scoped to `/` and `/index.html`.

**Purge via HTTP `PURGE` method (requires VCL handler):**

Varnish does not purge out of the box. The operator must wire a PURGE handler in VCL. Typical config ([upstream example](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/purging.html#http-purging)):

```vcl
acl purge {
    "127.0.0.1";
    "<ops-jumphost-ip>";
}

sub vcl_recv {
    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
        if (!client.ip ~ purge) {
            return (synth(405, "PURGE not allowed for this client"));
        }
        return (purge);
    }
}
```

Then, from a permitted host:

```bash
curl -sSI -X PURGE http://<varnish-host>:<varnish-port>/
curl -sSI -X PURGE http://<varnish-host>:<varnish-port>/index.html
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 Purged (or 404 if the object wasn't in cache — still fine).
```

**Ban (wildcard):**

```bash
# Requires `varnishadm` access on the Varnish host.
varnishadm ban "req.url == / || req.url == /index.html"

# Wildcard example — invalidate every /assets/* path (rare; only if a proxy snapshot
# is serving the wrong bytes for a hashed chunk):
varnishadm ban "req.url ~ ^/assets/"
```

Confirm the ban landed:

```bash
varnishadm ban.list
```

### Generic CDN (Fastly, Akamai, CloudFront, Bunny.net, others)

General principles that apply to any CDN. Consult the vendor's docs for exact commands:

1. **Locate the "purge" control.** Every production CDN offers a purge mechanism. The vocabulary differs: "invalidate" (CloudFront), "instant purge" (Fastly), "purge" (Bunny.net / Akamai). All mean the same thing.
2. **Prefer URL-scoped purge over full-cache purge.** The URLs you care about are `/` and `/index.html`. Hashed `/assets/*` paths do not need invalidation: they change filename on every deploy.
3. **Authenticate via the vendor's API token, not shared credentials.** Put the token in an env var; do not paste it into a runbook.
4. **Expect a propagation window.** Edge purge is not instant: common SLAs are 30 seconds to 5 minutes. If `curl` still shows the old content 60 seconds after purge, check the vendor's status page before escalating.
5. **Bypass cache in the client during verification.** Append a cachebust query parameter to rule out client-side caches: `curl -sS "https://<public-host>/?_cb=$(date +%s)"`. If the bundle is still stale with a unique query string, the origin is stale, not the CDN.

Vendor docs to start from. Do **not** copy syntax without reading these; the APIs change:

- AWS CloudFront: [CreateInvalidation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Invalidation.html).
- Fastly: [Purging: API reference](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/reference/api/purging/).
- Akamai: [Fast Purge API](https://techdocs.akamai.com/purge-cache/reference/api).
- Bunny.net: [Purge URL / Pull Zone](https://docs.bunny.net/reference/purgepublic_index).

## Verify cache is flushed

After purging, re-run the diagnosis in reverse: you are checking that every hop now returns the current server bundle.

1. **Re-fetch `index.html` through the edge** and confirm the hashes match `SERVER_HASHES`:

   ```bash
   curl -sS "https://<public-host>/?_cb=$(date +%s)" | grep -oE '/assets/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.(js|css)' | sort -u
   ```

   The `?_cb=<timestamp>` is a cachebust against any layer that keys on query string (common). If the cache keys on path only, the bust has no effect, which is fine. The check still tells you the current answer.

2. **Check cache-status headers** on the next clean request (no cachebust):

   ```bash
   curl -sSI https://<public-host>/
   ```

   Expected, depending on proxy:

   | Proxy | Expected header after purge + one cold fetch |
   |-|-|
   | nginx | `X-Cache-Status: MISS` on first request, `HIT` on subsequent (with the new content). |
   | Cloudflare | `CF-Cache-Status: MISS` → `HIT` on subsequent. `DYNAMIC` is also fine: it means not cached at all. |
   | Varnish | `X-Cache: MISS` → `HIT` on subsequent. `X-Varnish` with one ID = fresh miss; two IDs = hit. |
   | CloudFront / other | `X-Cache: Miss from cloudfront` → `Hit from cloudfront`. |
   | Any RFC 9111 cache | `Age: 0` on first request after purge. If `Age` is non-zero immediately after purge, the purge did not land. |

3. **Asset-hash cross-check**: the ground-truth test:

   ```bash
   # Container (ground truth):
   CONTAINER_HASHES=$(docker exec ecm-ecm-1 grep -oE '/assets/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.(js|css)' /app/static/index.html | sort -u)

   # Through the proxy:
   EDGE_HASHES=$(curl -sS "https://<public-host>/?_cb=$(date +%s)" | grep -oE '/assets/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.(js|css)' | sort -u)

   # Must match:
   diff <(echo "$CONTAINER_HASHES") <(echo "$EDGE_HASHES")
   # Expected: no output (identical).
   ```

4. **End-user verification**: have at least one reporting user run the
   [browser-side hash check](./dep-bump-frontend-regression.md#4-browser-cache-verification-is-the-user-on-the-rolled-back-bundle)
   from the companion runbook. Only when their `document.scripts` output
   matches `CONTAINER_HASHES` is the incident closed.

## Escalation

Page the Project Engineer if:

- Purge appears to succeed (HTTP 200 from the purge endpoint, vendor dashboard shows the purge event) but `EDGE_HASHES` still diverges from `CONTAINER_HASHES` after 5 minutes.
- The in-container check matches the fresh deploy, `curl` through the proxy matches, **but** users still report stale bundles after a hard reload. This usually means a corporate / ISP transparent proxy sits between the user and your edge; operators rarely have control over this layer.
- The reverse proxy or CDN is operated by a third party you cannot purge against (managed hosting, shared-edge provider): the escalation is to the third party, not to Engineering.

Provide to the engineer: `/tmp/ecm-infra-cache-headers.txt`, the diff output from step 3 above, the list of purge attempts made (vendor, timestamp, response code), and the reporting-user report.

## Post-incident

- [ ] If the operator's infra emitted no `Cache-Control` hints on `/` or `/index.html` and relied on proxy heuristics, file a bead to recommend they adopt the `Cache-Control: no-cache` on `/` + `immutable` on `/assets/*` pattern in the next release notes. (ECM itself does not set these today; see the "What ECM emits today" section.)
- [ ] If this incident exposed a specific proxy the runbook does not cover, add a section here with the vendor's exact purge commands and the matching cache-status header.
- [ ] If multiple releases in a row required an infra-side purge, file a bead under observability to expose a "deploy succeeded but edge still stale" metric (needs instrumented edge, out of scope for ECM itself, but flagging the gap is the SRE's job).
- [ ] Update this runbook with any new cache-status header / vendor pattern seen during the incident.
