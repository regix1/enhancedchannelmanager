# Runbook: NormalizationPolicy Unified Mode (GH #104 Rollback Switch)

Owner: SRE. Source: bd-eio04.1 (absorbs bd-eio04.4), under epic bd-eio04.

## What this runbook covers

Starting with bd-eio04.1 (release that closes GH #104), the normalization
engine's Test Rules preview path and its Channel Pipeline execution path
share a single `NormalizationPolicy`. Both paths apply identical Unicode
preprocessing to every input:

1. **NFC canonicalization**: NFD-decomposed input (e.g. `e` + `U+0301`)
   collapses to pre-composed form (`U+00E9`). NFC, not NFKC: ligatures,
   fullwidth digits, and Roman-numeral compatibility forms are preserved.
2. **Narrow Cf-code-point stripping**: `U+200B` ZWSP, `U+200C` ZWNJ,
   `U+200D` ZWJ, and `U+FEFF` BOM are removed. RTL/LTR bidi marks
   (`U+200F`, `U+202E`) are **preserved** so channel names that use them
   intentionally are not mangled.
3. **Full superscript conversion**: both letter-superscripts
   (`ᴴᴰ` → `HD`, `ᴿᴬᵂ` → `RAW`) and numeric-superscripts
   (`ESPN²` → `ESPN2`, `⁶⁰fps` → `60fps`) convert on every code path.
   The prior `preserve_superscripts=True` carve-out was dropped in
   bd-eio04.1 because divergence between paths was the root cause of
   GH #104.

This is a **one-way-door** change for existing channel names: any
channel created before the fix that carried `²`, `³`, or other numeric
superscripts through the Channel Pipeline retains those glyphs. New channels
created after the fix will have ASCII digits instead.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|-|-|-|
| `ECM_NORMALIZATION_UNIFIED_POLICY` | `true` | When `true` (default), apply the unified policy (NFC + Cf-strip + full superscript conversion) on every normalization code path. Set to `false` to roll back to pre-bd-eio04.1 behavior (superscript conversion only, no NFC, no Cf-stripping). Accepted truthy values: `true`, `1`, `yes`, `on` (case-insensitive). Accepted falsy: `false`, `0`, `no`, `off`. |

The flag is latched at engine construction time. Change by setting the
env var in `docker-compose.yml` (or your container runtime) and
restarting the container. No image rebuild required.

## When to flip the flag to `false`

**This is a rollback switch, not a feature toggle.** Flip it only if
you hit one of the following:

- A report that the Channel Pipeline is producing channel names that diverge
  from what operators expect *because* of the new preprocessing (e.g. a
  downstream system that indexed `ESPN²` as the primary key).
- A Unicode edge case you did not anticipate (the engineer's best
  guess would be a homoglyph locale we do not test, track with a new
  bead, then flip the flag while that bead is worked).

Do **not** flip the flag to dodge a related failure elsewhere. If a
test or probe is failing, diagnose the cause first.

## How to flip the flag

```bash
# Example: docker-compose.yml
services:
  ecm:
    environment:
      - ECM_NORMALIZATION_UNIFIED_POLICY=false
```

Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d ecm
# or, for an ad-hoc restart:
docker restart ecm-ecm-1
```

Verify the flag was picked up:

```bash
docker exec ecm-ecm-1 python -c \
  "from normalization_engine import get_default_policy; \
   print(get_default_policy().unified_enabled)"
# Expected: False after rollback
```

## Symptoms → Diagnosis → Action

### Symptom: Test Rules preview and auto-created channel names diverge again

Either the flag was set to `false` (intentional rollback) or the policy
singleton was not reloaded after a flag change. Check:

```bash
docker exec ecm-ecm-1 env | grep ECM_NORMALIZATION_UNIFIED_POLICY
docker exec ecm-ecm-1 python -c \
  "from normalization_engine import get_default_policy; \
   print('unified_enabled:', get_default_policy().unified_enabled)"
```

If the env says `true` but the policy reports `False`, the container
was started before the flag was set. Restart the container.

### Symptom: Channel names now strip characters that users expected to keep

If the "characters" are superscripts, BOM/ZWSP/ZWNJ/ZWJ, or NFD-form
accents, this is the intended behavior. The fix corrected a
long-running divergence. Explain to the user that Test Rules now
matches what the Channel Pipeline produces, and their stored names will
converge on the canonical form as channels are recreated.

If the characters are **bidi marks** (U+200F, U+202E), **ligatures**
(`ﬁ`), or **fullwidth digits** (`１`), that's a bug: open a bead
with the reproducer. The policy uses NFC (not NFKC) and a narrow Cf
whitelist specifically to preserve these.

### Symptom: Post-rollback, NFC tests fail in CI

Expected if CI runs against the disabled flag. The parity suite
(`backend/tests/unit/test_normalization_parity.py`) has a
`TestLegacyPolicyFallback` class that exercises the disabled path
directly via `NormalizationPolicy(unified_enabled=False)`: those
remain green. The `TestPinnedRegressions::test_nfd_cafe_normalizes_to_nfc`
test will fail under the rollback, because the rollback explicitly does
not canonicalize NFD. Treat the NFC-specific failures as expected while
the flag is off.

## Decommissioning the flag

Once the unified policy has soaked in production for 30+ days with no
escalations tied to the behavior change, the flag should be removed.
File a follow-up bead under bd-eio04 to:

- Delete `_unified_policy_enabled()` and the `unified_enabled` field
  from `NormalizationPolicy`.
- Inline the unified branch of `NormalizationPolicy.apply_to_text`.
- Delete `TestLegacyPolicyFallback`.
- Remove this runbook.
