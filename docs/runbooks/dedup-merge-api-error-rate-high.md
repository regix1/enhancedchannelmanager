# Runbook: ECM Dedup Merge API Error Rate High

> **STUB: section headers + metric names present, real triage and resolution procedures pending.** This runbook ships at v0.17.1 alongside the SLO-10 alert rules (bd-ft3hk / BD-M) so the alert has a runbook_url to resolve. The procedures fill in as the team accumulates incident experience after BD-D/E/F deploy the metric emitters. If you are the first responder to this alert, the structure below is your skeleton. Capture what you do in real time and feed it back into this file via a follow-up bead.

- **Severity**: **P1 page.** This is the load-bearing write path of the dedup epic. A failed accept potentially leaves a channel in a half-merged state.
- **Owner**: SRE
- **Last reviewed**: 2026-05-16 (stub)
- **Related beads**: `enhancedchannelmanager-ft3hk` (this runbook + alert rule), `enhancedchannelmanager-1v4ht` (dedup epic), `enhancedchannelmanager-ct9wl` (existing single-merge 422 pattern), `enhancedchannelmanager-ozhkf` (bulk-merge 422 pattern), BD-E (merge endpoint)

**Alerts that route here:**

- `ECMDedupMergeApiErrorRateHigh` (**page**): `sum(rate(ecm_dedup_merge_requests_total{status="error"}[5m])) / sum(rate(ecm_dedup_merge_requests_total[5m])) > 0.01` sustained 5m, with a guard that total rate must exceed 0.01 req/s to avoid paging on a single mid-call exception during idle periods

## What this is

`POST /api/channel-merges/{id}/accept` is the load-bearing write path of the dedup epic: it executes the merge that the operator approved in the modal. The operation proxies to Dispatcharr (channel update with the merged stream list) and updates ECM-side state (delete source channels, record the merge in the dedup ledger).

The `status` label on `ecm_dedup_merge_requests_total`:

- `success`: accept completed end-to-end. The stream reached the candidate channel in Dispatcharr and the queue row went terminal.
- `error`: 5xx response or unhandled exception (the alert numerator).
- `dismissed`: operator dismissed instead of accepting (not an error, not a numerator event).
- `unapplied`: the accept was recorded but ECM could **not** apply it to Dispatcharr, so the queue row stayed `pending` and flagged (added 2026-08-16, bead `enhancedchannelmanager-i5ic0`). **Not an error.** The endpoint returned `200`, nothing failed, and the operator can retry the row. It is separated from `success` because SLI-10b counts terminal transitions out of the queue and this makes none.
- `cancelled`: operator started accept but cancelled mid-flow.

**`unapplied` is in this alert's denominator, not its numerator**, so a burst of unapplied accepts *lowers* the computed error rate rather than paging you. That is correct: the requests really did succeed. If you are here because the error rate looks suppressed while operators are complaining, check `unapplied` separately and go to [dedup-pending-merge-resolution-stale.md](./dedup-pending-merge-resolution-stale.md):

```promql
sum(rate(ecm_dedup_merge_requests_total{status="unapplied"}[5m]))
```

4xx responses are **explicitly excluded** from `status="error"`. A 422 on stale source IDs (the bd-ct9wl / bd-ozhkf pattern) is correct backend behavior, not service unreliability: that response correctly tells the frontend "refresh the channels list and try again."

## Why this matters

The merge endpoint is the single point in the dedup epic where ECM state and Dispatcharr state can drift apart. A failed accept can leave one of the following half-states:

1. **Target updated, sources not deleted**: the target channel got the merged streams but the source channels are still in Dispatcharr. The operator sees duplicates in the channels list and a phantom merge entry.
2. **Sources deleted, target not updated**: the source channels are gone from Dispatcharr but the target did not receive the streams. The streams are orphaned.
3. **Dedup-ledger updated, neither side reconciled**: the ECM-side merge record exists but neither Dispatcharr side reflects it.

Recovery from any half-state is manual and expensive. The page-severity alert exists so on-call can stop the bleeding before the half-merge count grows.

## Symptoms

- Operator-visible: "the merge succeeded but the source channels are still there" / "the merge failed but my stream is gone" / "I clicked merge and got a generic error."
- TODO: capture the characteristic error banner copy once BD-E's UI ships.
- `sum(rate(ecm_dedup_merge_requests_total{status="error"}[5m]))` climbing.
- TODO: log signature once BD-E logs the failure mode.

## First 5 minutes

1. **Confirm the alert is real.** Read the error ratio directly:
   ```promql
   sum(rate(ecm_dedup_merge_requests_total{status="error"}[5m]))
   / sum(rate(ecm_dedup_merge_requests_total[5m]))
   ```
   If `NaN` or below 1%, the alert should not have fired (rate guard); treat as a false positive and capture for tuning.

2. **Identify the half-merge candidates from the last 15 minutes.**
   ```bash
   docker logs ecm-ecm-1 --since 15m | grep '\[DEDUP\]' | grep -iE 'merge.*(error|exception|failed)'
   ```
   Capture every `target_channel` and `source_channel` ID that appears in an error line. These are the candidates for half-merge state.

3. **Check Dispatcharr connectivity.** If the proxy call to Dispatcharr is timing out, every merge fails the same way. This is a Dispatcharr incident, not a dedup-subsystem incident.
   ```bash
   docker exec ecm-ecm-1 python3 -c "import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('http://<dispatcharr-host>:<port>/api/health', timeout=5).read().decode())" || echo DOWN
   ```

4. **Cross-reference broader 5xx rate.** If `ECMHTTPError5xxElevated` is also firing, the merge endpoint is a downstream symptom of a broader backend failure. Go to [http_error_rate.md](./http_error_rate.md) first.

## Diagnosis

TODO: fill in as the team accumulates incident experience. Initial branches to investigate:

### Branch A: Dispatcharr proxy failure

The most expected failure mode: Dispatcharr returns 5xx or times out partway through the merge. The half-state risk is highest here because the source-delete and target-update are not in a shared transaction across the two systems.

- TODO: command to inspect the merge endpoint's transaction boundary.
- TODO: capture the exact log signature of "Dispatcharr returned X partway through merge."

### Branch B: SQLite lock contention

A long-running bulk operation (the Channel Pipeline, M3U import) holds a write lock; the merge endpoint's ECM-side update times out.

- Cross-reference: [stats-v2-write-failures.md](./stats-v2-write-failures.md) Branch B (same root cause class).

### Branch C: Unhandled exception in merge code

A code path in BD-E's merge logic raises an exception that is not caught: the request returns 500 and the global error handler increments `status="error"`.

- TODO: command to grep traceback lines.

## Resolution

TODO: fill in once the team has resolved at least one real incident. Mitigation priorities:

1. **Stop the bleeding.** Disable the merge endpoint via feature flag if available, or surface a "merge temporarily unavailable" banner to operators.
2. **Identify half-merge candidates.** Use the log-grep from step 2 above to identify every `(target_channel, source_channel)` pair from an error line in the incident window.
3. **Reconcile half-state.** For each half-merge candidate:
   - TODO: query to determine which of the three half-states applies.
   - TODO: command to either complete the merge (target update + source delete) or rollback (undelete sources, revert target stream list).
4. **Fix root cause.** Per the branch identified above.

## Escalation

If the alert persists more than 15 minutes after triage:

- Page on-call SRE AND PE for a coordinated look at the merge endpoint.
- Escalate to the dedup-epic owner (bd-1v4ht). Sustained merge failures may require disabling the dedup modal until the root cause is fixed.
- Consider opening an incident channel. Half-merge state across multiple channels needs a coordinated reconciliation.

## Post-incident

- [ ] Update this runbook with the actual diagnosis steps that worked, especially the half-state reconciliation queries.
- [ ] File a blameless postmortem. Page-severity incidents on a load-bearing write path warrant one.
- [ ] If the merge endpoint needs a structural fix (transactional boundary across ECM + Dispatcharr, idempotency token, two-phase commit), file an epic.
- [ ] If a new metric (per-failure-mode `reason` label on the error counter, bounded to a small set) would have made diagnosis faster, evaluate against the SLO-10 cardinality budget.
