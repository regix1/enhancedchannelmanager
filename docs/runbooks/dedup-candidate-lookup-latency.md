# Runbook: ECM Dedup Candidate-Lookup Latency High

> **STUB: section headers + metric names present, real triage and resolution procedures pending.** This runbook ships at v0.17.1 alongside the SLO-10 alert rules (bd-ft3hk / BD-M) so the alert has a runbook_url to resolve. The procedures fill in as the team accumulates incident experience after BD-D/E/F deploy the metric emitters. If you are the first responder to this alert, the structure below is your skeleton. Capture what you do in real time and feed it back into this file via a follow-up bead.

- **Severity**: P3 warning
- **Owner**: SRE
- **Last reviewed**: 2026-05-16 (stub)
- **Related beads**: `enhancedchannelmanager-ft3hk` (this runbook + alert rule), `enhancedchannelmanager-1v4ht` (dedup epic), BD-B (dedup index), BD-D (candidate-lookup endpoint)

**Alerts that route here:**

- `ECMDedupCandidateLookupLatencyHigh` (warning): `histogram_quantile(0.99, ecm_dedup_candidate_lookup_duration_seconds_bucket) > 500ms` sustained 10m

**SLO:** [SLO-10a Candidate Lookup Latency](../sre/slos.md#slo-10-channel-deduplication-v0171-dedup-epic-bd-1v4ht-bd-ft3hk)

## What this is

The channel-merge candidate-lookup endpoint (`POST /api/channel-merges/candidates`, BD-D) is the server-side matcher that produces the candidate list shown in the merge prompt on drag-drop, add-stream, and bulk M3U import triggers. Its p99 latency is the operator-visible "did the modal pop instantly or did it stutter" signal.

The histogram metric `ecm_dedup_candidate_lookup_duration_seconds` is emitted by the BD-D endpoint wrapper. The matcher reads channels/streams from the same SQLite instance ECM already queries on every page load, so it shares the database substrate with every other backend hot path.

## Why this matters

The merge modal is interactive UI: operators drag, drop, and expect a candidate list within "instant" human perception (~250ms is the upper bound for "feels instant"). The 500ms SLO threshold leaves 2× headroom, so a sustained breach means the matcher has stopped serving the interaction smoothly. Operators perceive stalls as bugs, not slow queries, and the dedup epic loses operator trust quickly.

## Symptoms

- TODO: capture the user-visible symptom (modal hang, partial render, etc.) from the first real incident.
- `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le) (rate(ecm_dedup_candidate_lookup_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])))` > 0.5 sustained.
- TODO: characteristic log signature once we know what BD-D logs on slow paths.

## First 10 minutes

1. **Confirm the alert is real.** Read the p99 directly:
   ```promql
   histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le) (rate(ecm_dedup_candidate_lookup_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])))
   ```
   If `NaN`, the matcher is not being called (no current activity). The alert should not have fired; treat as a false positive and capture for tuning.

2. **TODO: pull recent request logs.** Once BD-D logs the matcher invocation with timing, the grep pattern goes here. Expected format something like:
   ```bash
   docker logs ecm-ecm-1 --since 15m | grep '\[DEDUP\] candidate_lookup'
   ```

3. **Check broader backend latency.** If `ECMHTTPLatencyHighP95` is also firing, this is not dedup-specific. Go to [http_latency.md](./http_latency.md) first. Otherwise the matcher is the regression.

## Diagnosis

TODO: fill in as the team accumulates incident experience. Initial branches to investigate:

### Branch A: The dedup index regressed

If a database migration or query refactor caused the candidate matcher to stop using the dedup index (BD-B's index design), every lookup performs a full scan instead of an indexed lookup.

- TODO: command to inspect query plan.
- TODO: command to verify the dedup index exists and is being used.

### Branch B: The matcher is called inside a per-channel handler loop

A regression class where a caller forgets the "one matcher call per trigger" contract and invokes the matcher inside a request-handler loop, multiplying the latency by N channels.

- TODO: caller-side log signature to look for.

### Branch C: SQLite is under bulk-write contention

The matcher shares the database with the Channel Pipeline, bulk-merge, and M3U import paths. A long-running bulk operation can starve the matcher.

- TODO: command to identify the bulk operation in flight.
- Cross-reference: same root cause class as [stats-v2-write-failures.md](./stats-v2-write-failures.md) Branch B.

## Resolution

TODO: fill in once the team has resolved at least one real incident. Likely categories:

1. **Index regression**: re-create the dedup index, re-run query plan check.
2. **Per-channel loop**: revert the offending caller change, add a regression test.
3. **Bulk-write contention**: throttle or schedule the bulk operation off-peak; matcher self-heals once the lock clears.

## Escalation

If the alert persists more than 1 hour after triage:

- Page on-call SRE with: current p99, log snippets from `[DEDUP]` lines, output of the query-plan check.
- Cross-reference `ECMDedupMergeApiErrorRateHigh`: if both are firing, treat as a dedup-subsystem incident, not isolated latency.

## Post-incident

- [ ] Update this runbook with the actual diagnosis steps that worked.
- [ ] If a new metric or label would have made diagnosis faster, file a bead for it.
- [ ] If the matcher needs a structural fix (different index, query rewrite, caching layer), file an epic.
