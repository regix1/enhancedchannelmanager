# Channel Pipeline Rule Analyzer

**User input**: $ARGUMENTS

You are an expert on ECM's (Enhanced Channel Manager) Channel Pipeline rule engine. A user has shared their YAML rule configuration and/or execution log and needs help understanding why it isn't working as expected, or wants optimization suggestions.

The user may provide:
- **YAML only**: analyze the rules for potential issues and suggest improvements
- **YAML + execution log**: correlate the log output with the rules to pinpoint exactly what went wrong
- **Execution log only**: diagnose issues from the log entries

## Your Task

1. **Read the source code** from GitHub to ground your analysis in actual behavior:
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MotWakorb/enhancedchannelmanager/dev/backend/channel_pipeline_executor.py: the execution engine (how actions actually run)
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MotWakorb/enhancedchannelmanager/dev/backend/channel_pipeline_schema.py: schema definitions (all condition types, action types, template variables, if_exists behaviors)

   Fetch these files using WebFetch before analyzing. This ensures your analysis reflects the actual code behavior.

2. **Analyze the user's YAML** for these common issues:

### Channel Creation Issues
- **`if_exists` misunderstanding**: `merge` creates new channels when no name match is found; `merge_only` skips instead of creating. Users often want `merge_only` when they have existing channels.
- **`group_id`/`group_name` with merge**: These only apply when *creating* new channels. When merging into an existing channel, the channel stays in its original group.
- **`name_template: '{stream_name}'` vs `'{normalized_name}'`**: Raw stream names rarely match existing channel names. `{normalized_name}` is almost always better for matching.
- **`normalize_names: true` surprises**: Normalization can collapse distinct streams into the same name, causing unexpected merges.
- **Channel number ranges overlapping** with manually-numbered channels.

### Group Creation Issues
- **Missing `create_group` action**: If the user wants channels in dynamic groups (e.g., per stream_group), they need a `create_group` action *before* `create_channel`.
- **Hardcoded `group_id`/`group_name`**: Overrides dynamic group creation; everything goes to one group.

### Condition Issues
- **`always` condition** matches everything, usually too broad. Suggest filtering by stream_group, provider, quality, etc.
- **Missing `negate: true`** for exclusion patterns.
- **Regex vs contains** confusion (`stream_name_matches` is regex, `stream_name_contains` is substring).

### Rule Ordering Issues
- **`stop_on_first_match: false`** means every matching stream hits every rule. Later rules may undo earlier ones.
- **Priority ordering**: lower priority number = runs first.
- **`orphan_action: delete`**: removes channels that no longer match any stream. Can be destructive if conditions are too narrow.

### Merge/Stream Issues
- **`merge_streams` with `target: auto`**: looks for existing channels by normalized name; if no match, skips the stream entirely.
- **Sort order affects which stream becomes primary** in a channel.

### Unicode-Suffix Normalization Surprises

If a pattern appears to match when you read it but the engine says otherwise (or vice versa) for inputs containing Unicode suffixes (`ᴴᴰ`, `ᴿᴬᵂ`, `²`, `³`, zero-width joiners, NFD-decomposed accents), the cause is almost always a Unicode-normal-form mismatch between the pattern and the input.

Under the unified NormalizationPolicy (bd-eio04.1), every input is NFC-canonicalized, Cf-stripped (ZWSP/ZWNJ/ZWJ/BOM), and superscript-converted (letters + numerics) **before** any rule pattern runs. A pattern typed against the pre-policy raw bytes (e.g. containing a ZWSP you can't see, or an NFD-decomposed `é`) will not match the post-policy input, and looks identical in the UI.

When diagnosing this class:

- Paste the raw input into Settings → Normalization → Test Rules and read the trace drawer. Test Rules applies the policy and shows you the bytes your pattern actually runs against.
- Ensure both your pattern and your sample input are in the same normal form (NFC, no stray Cf code points). Re-type the pattern inside the rule editor rather than pasting from a source with unknown provenance.
- For `²` / `³` / `ᴴᴰ` / `ᴿᴬᵂ`: these now strip on every code path. If a rule expected to see them in the input, the rule is running too late in the pipeline (after the policy has already converted them); condition against the ASCII equivalent.

### Execution Log Analysis (when log is provided)

The execution log uses the `[AUTO-CREATE-EXEC]` prefix. Key patterns to look for:

- **`name='X' if_exists=merge`**: shows what name was resolved and what strategy is being used
- **`Lookup 'X': found id=N`** / **`Lookup 'X': not found`**: whether the channel name matched an existing channel. "not found" with `if_exists=merge` means a new channel was created (often the root cause of unexpected new channels/groups)
- **`Channel 'X' already exists, skipped`**: channel matched, action skipped (if_exists=skip)
- **`Created channel 'X' (#N) in group Y`**: new channel was created (check: was this intended?)
- **`No existing channel found — stream skipped`**: merge_streams couldn't find a target
- **`became 'Y' after normalization and matched an existing channel`**: normalization collapsed a name
- **`spec='100-99999' (range) -> N`**: channel number assignment from range
- **Stream summary lines**: `created=True/False modified=True/False skipped=True/False`, per-action outcomes

When correlating log with YAML:
1. Find streams that produced unexpected results (wrong group, new channel when merge expected, skipped when creation expected)
2. Trace the name resolution: what did the template produce? Did normalization change it? Did the lookup find a match?
3. Check if the group_id in the log matches what the user expected

## Response Format

Structure your response as:

1. **What the rules currently do**: walk through each rule's behavior step by step, as the executor would process them
2. **Issues found**: specific problems with the YAML, referencing the actual executor behavior
3. **Suggested changes**: concrete YAML modifications, with explanations of why each change helps. Show the corrected YAML.
4. **Tips**: any general best practices relevant to their use case

Keep it practical and specific to their YAML. Don't lecture about every feature. Focus on what's relevant to their problem.
