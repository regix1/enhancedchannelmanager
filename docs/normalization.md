# Normalization

> How ECM collapses noisy stream names into the channel names you want, across Test Rules (the preview you try before saving) and the Channel Pipeline (the engine that actually makes channels). This guide is dual-audience: the first half is for operators authoring rules; the [Developer reference](#developer-reference) at the bottom is for engineers integrating with the engine.

## Overview

Normalization is the step between "raw name from an M3U line" and "channel name on disk." It runs in four places:

- **Test Rules**: Settings → Channel Normalization → the preview panel where you paste a sample name and see what the current rule set produces. Safe to use freely; no side effects.
- **Channel Pipeline**: the Channel Pipeline reads the stream's raw name, passes it through the same rule set, and uses the output as the channel name (or as the lookup key for matching an existing channel).
- **Re-normalize Existing Channels**: a one-time bulk rewrite that reapplies the current rule set to channels already on disk. Manual, gated, undoable.
- **The Create Channels dialog**: the operator-facing **Normalization Rules** toggle, described in [Create Channels: the "Normalization Rules" toggle is also the merge key](#create-channels-the-normalization-rules-toggle-is-also-the-merge-key) below. It resolves through `POST /api/normalization/normalize`, so it is the same engine and the same rule set.

The first three paths **must produce the same output for the same input**. That is the *parity contract*, added in bd-eio04.1 and enforced by a nightly canary ([SLO-5 in `docs/sre/slos.md`](sre/slos.md#slo-5-normalization-correctness)). If a user reports "Test Rules says one thing and my auto-created channel got a different name," that is a canary-level bug. Follow [the divergence runbook](runbooks/normalization-canary-divergence.md) instead of working around it with a rule change. The Create Channels path is **not** a canary leg (`backend/scripts/normalization_canary.py` exercises `POST /api/normalization/test-batch` and a direct `engine.normalize` call), but its endpoint `POST /api/normalization/normalize` dispatches to `engine.test_rules_batch`, which is the same call `test-batch` makes.

### When does normalization run?

- **Test Rules**: on demand, when you click "Test" in the rules UI or call `POST /api/normalization/test` / `test-batch`.
- **Channel Pipeline**: on every stream name processed by a Channel Pipeline rule that has a normalization group configured. If no group is configured on the rule, normalization is **skipped**. `ecm_auto_creation_channels_created_total{normalized="skipped"}` increments.
- **Re-normalize Existing Channels**: only when an operator explicitly runs it via the Settings UI or `POST /api/normalization/apply-to-channels`. Never automatic.
- **Create Channels dialog**: when the dialog's **Normalization Rules** toggle is on, once for the preview (debounced 250 ms) and once more at submit time, both through `resolveCreateChannelNames` in `frontend/src/services/streamNormalization.ts`. With the toggle off it does not run and the raw provider names are used. If the engine cannot be reached, the create proceeds with raw names and reports a **Normalization failed** notification rather than passing them off as a clean result.

### What normalization is not

- It is not search. `GET /api/channels?search=foo` does its own matching without invoking the normalization rule set.
- It is not EPG matching. EPG match uses channel name + TVG-ID against EPG data; normalization affects the channel name that feeds into EPG match but is not itself EPG logic.
- It is not a regex sandbox. Regex rules run under `safe_regex` (100 ms timeout, bounded pattern size); pathological patterns fail fast with `[SAFE_REGEX]` WARN in logs and are rejected at save time by the linter.
- It is not the **fold match key** (GH #645). The opt-in per-rule flag `fold_match_key` (Channel Pipeline rule editor: *"Ignore spacing & case differences when matching"*) and the Find Duplicates *"Ignore spacing differences"* toggle compare names by a canonical key: casefold + strip ALL whitespace, one shared helper (`backend/match_fold.py`) for both surfaces, all **without ever rewriting the visible channel name**. Normalization rules transform stored names; the fold only changes how names are *compared* during the `create_channel` `if_exists: merge` lookup and duplicate grouping. Because the fold never touches stored names, the parity contract below is unaffected by it. Caveat: with the fold on, genuinely distinct channels whose names differ only by spacing/case merge too, including spacing inside digit runs ("Canal 5 2" vs "Canal 52" fold to the same key) and word boundaries ("Sky Cinema" vs "SkyCinema"). That is why it is opt-in and off by default.

## Quick start

### Your first rule

1. Open **Settings → Channel Normalization**.
2. Pick a rule group (or create one). Groups are ordering buckets: rules within a group run in priority order, groups run in group-priority order.
3. Click **Add rule**. Choose a condition and an action.
4. Expand the **Test Rules** panel above the rule groups, paste a sample raw name (one per line), and click **Run Test**.
5. Review the output. If it matches your intent, **Save**. If not, iterate on the rule before saving. You don't pay for retries on the preview path.

![Settings → Channel Normalization showing the Normalization Rules Engine header, the Test Rules panel expanded with sample inputs, and the Results list showing Original → Normalized with a rule-trace line under each entry](images/normalization/normalization-test-rules.png)

### Testing a rule before you commit

Test Rules is the single source of truth for "what will the Channel Pipeline do with this input." If Test Rules shows the output you want, the Channel Pipeline will produce that same output. If it does not, **do not** work around the rule. File a bug: divergence between the two paths is the exact failure class the parity contract and SLO-5 canary exist to catch.

- `POST /api/normalization/test`: single rule, single input. Useful when authoring one rule at a time.
- `POST /api/normalization/test-batch`: all enabled rules, multiple inputs. Use this to preview a batch (e.g., pasting 50 raw names from a new M3U).

## Concepts

### Create Channels: the "Normalization Rules" toggle is also the merge key

The **Normalization Rules** toggle in the Create Channels dialog (Channel Manager → Edit Mode → select streams → **Create** or **Create in…**) used to drive only the preview: names were normalized whichever way it was set, and the toggle's value was dropped before it reached the wire. It now decides the question, once, before anything is staged, and the name it produces is final. Nothing downstream normalizes again, which matters because the resolved name already carries the channel-number and country prefixes applied on top of the engine's output; a second pass would normalize an already-normalized name.

The consequence that surprises operators is not about spelling. **The resolved name is the key the bulk create merges streams on**, so the toggle changes how many channels a create produces:

| Toggle | Streams `US: CNN` and `CNN`, with a rule that strips `US:` | Result |
|-|-|-|
| On | Both resolve to `CNN` | **One** channel carrying two streams |
| Off | They stay `US: CNN` and `CNN` | **Two** separate channels |

The toggle's starting position comes from **Settings → Channel Normalization → Default Behavior → "Apply normalization by default when creating channels"** (`normalize_on_channel_create`, default `false`). It is per-operation from there: changing it in the dialog does not change the setting.

Because the count changes, so does everything sized from it: which channel numbers the batch claims, how the push-down conflict plan is sized when those numbers collide, and the number range the dialog shows. Every one of those surfaces now reads the same resolution the create uses, so the preview count and the staged count cannot disagree. Before, the dialog counted from the raw provider names whatever the toggle said, so with normalization on it could promise two channels and stage one. See [Assign Streams to Channels](user_guide/channels-streams/assign-streams-to-channels.md) for the operator-facing walk-through.

Three further behaviours worth knowing:

- **A failure is reported, not swallowed.** An unreachable engine used to return every name mapped to itself, which is byte-for-byte identical to turning the toggle off, so the two were indistinguishable at every layer above. The create now raises a **Normalization failed** notification and the dialog's preview says it could not reach the engine instead of claiming "no names will change". The channels are still created, under the raw names.
- **Manual entry offers the control too.** Creating a channel by typing a name rather than from a stream renders the same toggle, with a live preview of the typed name (debounced 250 ms). It was briefly removed on the grounds that manual entry has no provider name to normalize; the typed name is a name, and the control is wired to it instead.
- **Duplicate detection does not depend on it.** The interactive dedup matcher receives the *raw* provider name, before the dialog exists, and applies its own cleaner. Turning the toggle off does not weaken duplicate protection. See [Stream Deduplication](user_guide/channels-streams/stream-dedup.md).

REST and MCP callers get the same disclosure through the `normalization` object on `POST /api/channels` and the `normalizationFailures` list on `POST /api/channels/bulk-commit`. See [`docs/api.md` §Channels](api.md#channels).

### Rule groups and ordering

Rules live in groups. Groups run in **group priority** order (lowest number first). Within a group, rules run in **rule priority** order (lowest first). A rule's output feeds into the next rule's input. It's a pipeline, not a set of independent matchers.

Consequences:

- A rule later in the pipeline sees the *output* of earlier rules, not the raw input. If rule 1 strips `HD` and rule 2 matches `HD`, rule 2 will not fire against the original input.
- Groups are a coarse bucket for sharing across Channel Pipeline rules. You can assign one group to many Channel Pipeline rules; the same group applied twice will produce the same output (idempotent).

### NormalizationPolicy: the Unicode preprocessor

Before any user-authored rule runs, a **policy** preprocesses the input. The policy is not configurable per rule. It applies uniformly to every code path. Under the default `ECM_NORMALIZATION_UNIFIED_POLICY=true` (bd-eio04.1), the policy does three things in order:

1. **NFC canonicalization.** NFD-decomposed input (`e` + U+0301) collapses to pre-composed form (`é` = U+00E9). NFC, *not* NFKC: ligatures (`ﬁ`), fullwidth digits (`１`), and Roman-numeral compatibility forms are preserved because users who typed them intended them.
2. **Cf-whitelist stripping.** `U+200B` ZWSP, `U+200C` ZWNJ, `U+200D` ZWJ, and `U+FEFF` BOM are removed. RTL/LTR bidi marks (`U+200F`, `U+202E`) are **preserved**. Some right-to-left channel names need them.
3. **Full superscript conversion.** Letter-superscripts (`ᴴᴰ` → `HD`, `ᴿᴬᵂ` → `RAW`) and numeric-superscripts (`²` → `2`, `⁶⁰` → `60`) both convert to ASCII. Both, always.
4. **(Opt-in)** **Confusables fold**: see [Confusables fold](#confusables-fold-opt-in-bd-sc5s4) below. Off by default; enable when homoglyph attacks are part of your threat model.

The policy is a [frozen dataclass](#developer-reference) applied at the same call site by Test Rules, the Channel Pipeline, and Re-normalize Existing Channels. It is not extensible from rule configuration: if you need a different Unicode preprocessing step, file a bead.

### Confusables fold (opt-in, bd-sc5s4)

Unicode contains many characters that render identically across scripts but occupy distinct code points. For example, Cyrillic `а` (U+0430) and Latin `a` (U+0061) look the same on screen but are byte-distinct. An attacker can register a stream named `chаnnel` (with a Cyrillic `а`) that visually matches a legitimate `channel`, defeating dedup, rule matching, and Channel Pipeline collision detection.

ECM ships with an opt-in **confusables fold** that maps a curated subset of Unicode TR39 confusables to Latin/ASCII *after* NFC + Cf-strip + superscript conversion. The fold is **off by default** because it is aggressive. It collapses characters that some operators want kept distinct (e.g. Greek alphabet channels, math-italic letters used as branding).

**Enable it** by setting `ECM_NORMALIZATION_CONFUSABLES_FOLD=true` and restarting the container. Once on, the fold applies uniformly to Test Rules, the Channel Pipeline, and Re-normalize Existing Channels. The parity contract is preserved.

**What gets folded** (curated subset, not the full ~6000-entry TR39 table):

| Class | Example input | After fold |
|-|-|-|
| Cyrillic look-alikes | `chаnnel` (а=U+0430) | `channel` |
| Greek capitals | `ΑBC` (Α=U+0391) | `ABC` |
| Math italic letters | `\U0001D44E` MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL A | `a` |
| Math bold digits | `\U0001D7CE` MATHEMATICAL BOLD DIGIT ZERO | `0` |
| Fullwidth Latin | `ＡＢＣ１` | `ABC1` |

**What does NOT fold** (intentionally):

- Accented Latin letters (`é`, `ñ`, `ü`): these are content, not confusables.
- Digit/letter look-alikes O/0, I/1/l: these collide more often than they prevent attacks.
- The full TR39 6000-entry table: operators who need broader coverage should layer their own normalization rules or file a bead.

**Rollback semantic**: with `ECM_NORMALIZATION_UNIFIED_POLICY=false` (legacy rollback path), the confusables fold is suppressed unconditionally. The rollback switch retains its byte-for-byte semantic. To use the fold, the unified policy must also be enabled (which is the default).

**When to enable**: enable only if (a) you have evidence of homoglyph-based collisions in your feed, or (b) you operate a multi-tenant deployment where stream names come from untrusted sources. For single-operator / trusted-feed deployments the default-off behavior is correct. The false-positive risk (collapsing a legitimate Cyrillic channel name into Latin) outweighs the attack surface.

### Letter vs numeric superscripts: both now strip

Before bd-eio04.1, numeric superscripts were preserved (the `preserve_superscripts=True` carve-out). After bd-eio04.1, both letter and numeric superscripts strip, on every path. This was the root cause of GH #104: one path preserved `²`, another stripped it, and channels created on different paths got different names.

If a channel name created before the bd-eio04.1 cutover still carries `²`, `³`, or `ᴴᴰ`, its stored name is pre-fix data. New channels created after the cutover will have ASCII digits. To reconcile, run [Re-normalize Existing Channels](#re-normalize-existing-channels).

### Unicode handling: what survives, what does not

| Class | Example input | After policy |
|-|-|-|
| ASCII | `ESPN HD` | `ESPN HD` (unchanged) |
| NFD decomposed accent | `Café` | `Café` (NFC) |
| Letter-superscript | `ESPN ᴴᴰ` | `ESPN HD` |
| Numeric-superscript | `ESPN²` | `ESPN2` |
| ZWSP / ZWNJ / ZWJ | `RTL​HD` | `RTLHD` |
| BOM | `﻿ESPN` | `ESPN` |
| RTL/LTR bidi marks | `‏ESPN‮` | preserved |
| Ligature | `ﬁrst` | `ﬁrst` (preserved; NFC, not NFKC) |
| Fullwidth digit | `ESPN１` | `ESPN１` (preserved; NFC) |

## Authoring rules

### Condition types

- **`contains`**: substring match, case-insensitive.
- **`starts_with` / `ends_with`**: anchored substring, case-insensitive.
- **`regex`**: Python regex via `safe_regex` (100 ms timeout, size-bounded). Patterns run against the post-policy input.
- **`equals`**: exact string match.
- **Compound**: boolean combinations via the `conditions[]` JSON; useful when one rule needs to match multiple unrelated suffixes.

### Action types

- **`replace`**: replace the matched portion with a literal string.
- **`remove`**: replace the matched portion with the empty string.
- **`set`**: overwrite the entire name with a literal (use sparingly; defeats composition).
- **Conditional else-action**: the `else_action_value` branch fires when the condition does *not* match. Useful for "strip suffix if present, pass through otherwise."

`action_value` and `else_action_value` are literal templates. They are **not** regexes and **not** linted for regex safety.

### Pattern linting: what gets rejected and why

Regex patterns go through two checks:

- **Runtime**: `safe_regex.search/match/sub` with a 100 ms timeout (bd-eio04.5). A pattern that takes longer raises a `[SAFE_REGEX]` WARN log line and the rule acts as if it did not match for that input (no crash, no partial result).
- **Write-time linter**: `POST /api/normalization/rules` and `PATCH /api/normalization/rules/{id}` run the pattern through the lint scanner (bd-eio04.7) and reject pathological patterns with HTTP 422 before they land on disk. Rejected classes include:
  - Unbounded repetition of a group that contains another repetition (`(a+)+`, `(.*)*`): classic ReDoS shapes.
  - Bounded repetitions with counts above a safety ceiling.
  - Lookbehind + lookahead combinations that push the engine into backtracking spirals.
  - Oversize literal patterns (>4 KB).

See the Regex section in [`docs/style_guide.md`](style_guide.md) for the full style rules and rewrites for the common rejected shapes. <!-- pending bd-eio04.8: style_guide.md is in-flight as of 2026-04-22. -->

### Error messages and fixes

| 422 detail code | What it means | Fix |
|-|-|-|
| `regex:nested_quantifier` | Pattern contains a repetition inside a repetition (ReDoS shape) | Replace the inner group with a character class; use possessive/atomic matching where available. |
| `regex:oversize_bounded_repetition` | `{N,M}` with `N` or `M` over the ceiling | Use an unbounded `+` with an anchor, or split the pattern. |
| `regex:oversize_pattern` | Pattern length exceeds the safety ceiling | Split into multiple rules chained through the pipeline. |
| `regex:invalid_pattern` | Python's regex compiler rejected the pattern | Check bracket/paren balance, escape special characters. |
| `regex:runtime_timeout` | Not raised at save; logged at runtime as `[SAFE_REGEX] pattern timed out` | Rewrite the pattern (see style guide Regex section) then re-save to retrigger the linter. |

To surface already-saved rules that now fail the linter (e.g., a rule saved before the linter existed), call `GET /api/normalization/lint-findings`. The UI shows a **Flagged** badge next to any rule with open findings. This is a view-only scan. It does not disable or modify rules.

## Re-normalize existing channels

### When to use it

After a rule change, your new rules apply only to *new* auto-created channels. Channels already on disk keep their pre-change names. Re-normalize Existing Channels rewrites stored names to match what the current rule set would produce if run against their stored raw names.

Use it when:

- You added a rule to collapse a suffix class and want existing channels to pick up the collapse.
- You fixed a pathological rule (Resolution C in the [duplicate-channels runbook](runbooks/duplicate-channels-unicode-suffix.md)) and need the already-stored names to catch up.
- You imported rules from a YAML export and want their effect to apply retroactively.

Do **not** use it to force a one-off rename of a single channel. Edit the channel directly; Re-normalize is a bulk operation and leaves a journal trail for every row it touches.

### Dry-run preview walkthrough

1. Settings → Channel Normalization → **Apply to existing channels**.
2. The modal opens in **dry-run** mode by default. ECM computes the diff and shows one row per channel with a proposed new name.

   ![Apply Normalization to Existing Channels modal with the rule-trace drawer expanded on the first row, showing current_name, proposed name, rules-fired count, and a trace panel explaining the diff cause (in this case Unicode normalization only)](images/normalization/apply-to-channels-dry-run.png)

3. For each row you see:
   - `current_name`: what's stored today.
   - `new_name`: what the current rule set would produce.
   - `collision`: `true` if `new_name` matches another existing channel's name. In this case, `rename` is not a legal action; `merge` (into the colliding channel) or `skip` are the choices.
   - Rule-trace drawer: click to expand and see which rule_ids fired, in order, with the input and output at each step.

4. If the row is correct and the output is what you want, select **rename** (or **merge** if there's a collision you want to fold into an existing channel).
5. If the row is wrong, select **skip**. Unspecified rows default to **skip**. The endpoint will not touch a channel unless you explicitly asked.

### Per-row skip / accept / merge

The execute call takes an `actions[]` array keyed by `channel_id`. Only the channels listed are acted on; everything else is skipped. This is intentional. A bulk rewrite without per-row confirmation is the exact shape of every "we accidentally renamed 500 channels" postmortem.

### What happens to channel numbers, groups, and history

- **Channel numbers**: preserved. A rename does not renumber; a merge folds the source channel's streams into the target and deletes the source, so the source's number becomes available.
- **Channel groups**: preserved on rename; the merged channel stays in its original group on merge.
- **Watch history / stats**: preserved on rename (same `channel_id`); on merge, the source's history is deleted with the source row. The target's history is not backfilled.
- **Journal**: every rename and every merge is logged under the `normalization` category with the `rule_set_hash` computed at execute time. Use the **Journal** page (or `GET /api/journal?category=normalization`) to audit and to drive undo.

### Undo via journal, rollback

- Each journal entry carries enough information to reverse the action: the `channel_id`, the `before_name`, the `after_name`, and the merge pointer if applicable.
- The undo path is **manual**. There is no "undo all" button today. To reverse a rename, edit the channel back to `before_name` via the channels UI or `PATCH /api/channels/{id}`. To reverse a merge, you must recreate the source channel and re-link its streams; that is non-trivial and is the reason dry-run + per-row review is mandatory.
- If you need to roll back a whole run, the fastest path is a DB restore from backup (see [`docs/runbooks/v0.16.0-rollback.md`](runbooks/v0.16.0-rollback.md) for the rollback mechanics, though that runbook is for release rollback, not data rollback). File a bead before restoring so the scope is recorded.
- To roll back the *policy* (not data): flip `ECM_NORMALIZATION_UNIFIED_POLICY` back to `false` and restart per [`docs/runbooks/normalization-unified-policy.md`](runbooks/normalization-unified-policy.md).

## Troubleshooting

### "My rule doesn't match this input"

Work this checklist in order:

1. **NFC mismatch.** Is the input NFD-decomposed and your pattern composed (or vice versa)? The policy NFCs the input before rules run, but if your *pattern* was typed with composed characters and an older input had NFD, they now match; if your pattern has NFD and the input is now NFC (post-policy), they no longer match. Recompose the pattern.
2. **Homoglyph.** Cyrillic `А` (U+0410) and Latin `A` (U+0041) render identically. The default policy does NOT normalize homoglyphs: copy the exact bytes from the raw input into your pattern, OR enable the [confusables fold](#confusables-fold-opt-in-bd-sc5s4) (`ECM_NORMALIZATION_CONFUSABLES_FOLD=true`) so Cyrillic / Greek / math / fullwidth look-alikes collapse to Latin/ASCII before matching.
3. **Cf code point you didn't see.** `​` (ZWSP) is invisible. If the policy strips it, your pattern against `RTL HD` won't see the `​` that was in the raw input, which is correct behavior, but if you're testing against a pre-policy byte stream, the pattern will miss. Always use Test Rules (which applies the policy) for debugging, not raw-byte regex checks.
4. **Rule ordering.** Does an earlier rule in the pipeline already transform the input away from what your pattern expects? The Test Rules trace drawer shows the intermediate values; read it top-down.
5. **Regex timeout.** Check logs for `[SAFE_REGEX]` WARN mentioning your rule_id. If present, the pattern is timing out on this input. Rewrite per style guide.

### "Channel Pipeline stopped stripping country prefixes / quality suffixes after upgrade" (bd-0tryb)

Symptom: channels land with the full raw stream name (e.g., `DE: RTL 3840P` instead of `RTL`, or `RX: RELAX TROPICAL BEACH ᵁᴴᴰ 3840P` instead of `RELAX TROPICAL BEACH`). Test Rules shows the expected normalized output, so the engine is healthy.

Cause: per-rule normalization. The legacy `normalize_names: true` boolean was replaced in v0.16.0 by `normalization_group_ids` (a list of `NormalizationRuleGroup` IDs to apply on this rule). The migration sets `normalization_group_ids` to all enabled groups for any rule that had `normalize_names=true`; rules that had `normalize_names=false` (the default for new rules created before the migration) end up with `normalization_group_ids = NULL`, which means **normalization is skipped on that rule**, and so does the `merge_streams` core-name fallback that strips country/quality tags before channel lookup (see `channel_pipeline_executor.py` _merge_streams core-name branch).

Fix:

1. **UI**: Channel Pipeline page → edit the rule → **Normalization Groups** picker → select the groups you want this rule to apply (typically all enabled groups). Save. Re-run the rule.
2. **API**: `PUT /api/channel-pipeline/rules/{id}` with body `{"normalization_group_ids": [<ids>]}`. To list available group IDs: `GET /api/normalization/groups`.

Pre-existing channels created before you set the groups are not retroactively renamed by this change. They were stored with their original raw names. Use [Re-normalize existing channels](#re-normalize-existing-channels) (Settings UI or `POST /api/normalization/apply-to-channels`) for a one-shot cleanup.

Verification:

- Test Rules with the raw stream name should already show the desired normalized output (proof the engine and tag groups are correct).
- After enabling `normalization_group_ids`, run the rule in **dry-run mode** first and inspect the execution log for `Normalization applied` entries. These confirm the new behavior on the actual streams.

### "Auto-creation created duplicate channels that differ only by spacing" (GH #645)

Symptom: a rule with `if_exists: merge` produced several channels for the same logical channel, e.g. `eurosport 2`, `Eurosport 2`, `Eurosport2`, `eurosport2`.

Cause: the merge lookup compares names case-insensitively but does **not** collapse whitespace, so `Eurosport 2` and `Eurosport2` are different names. Enabling normalization groups on the rule does not change this. User normalization rules collapse *runs* of whitespace to one space but never remove single interior spaces.

Fix (two halves, both opt-in):

1. **Stop new duplicates**: edit the rule → enable **"Ignore spacing & case differences when matching"** (`fold_match_key`). Future runs compare names by a folded key (casefold + strip all whitespace) so all four spellings merge into whichever channel exists first. Stored names are never rewritten.
2. **Clean up existing duplicates**: Channel Manager → select the channels → Find Duplicates → enable **"Ignore spacing differences"**. The same folded key groups the existing spelling variants so you can bulk-merge them.

Leave both off if your provider uses spacing/case to distinguish genuinely different channels. Note that digit runs collide too ("Canal 5 2" and "Canal 52" fold to the same key).

### `[SAFE_REGEX]` log entries

```
[SAFE_REGEX] pattern timed out rule_id=42 pattern=<redacted>
[SAFE_REGEX] oversize pattern rejected field=condition_value
[SAFE_REGEX] compile error at search pattern=<redacted>
```

- **Timeout**: the pattern exceeded 100 ms against a specific input. The rule *did not match* for that input; the log is the only signal. Rewrite the pattern and re-save.
- **Oversize**: caught at runtime as a secondary defense; the write-time linter should have caught it first. If you see this without a matching 422 on save, file a bead.
- **Compile error**: pattern is malformed. The write-time linter should reject these; a compile error at runtime means the pattern was stored before the linter existed.

### Flagged pre-lint rows

`GET /api/normalization/lint-findings` returns one entry per saved rule that would fail the current linter. Rows are not disabled or modified automatically. The scan is view-only. The UI surfaces these in the rule list with a **Flagged** badge.

To clear a flag: edit the rule, fix the pattern per style guide, save. The linter runs on save and the finding is cleared when the pattern passes.

### Self-serve diagnosis: `trace_id` + metrics

Every HTTP request carries a `trace_id` (from the `X-Request-ID` response header, or generated if absent). Structured logs tag every line with the trace_id, so a user report of "Test Rules gave me a weird output at 14:23 UTC" can be pinned to the exact sequence of log lines.

Dashboard metrics to watch during a normalization incident:

- `ecm_normalization_rule_matches_total{rule_category}`: rate of matches per rule category. A rule category that dropped to 0 after a change is a strong signal the change broke matching.
- `ecm_normalization_no_change_total`: count of `normalize()` calls that produced no output change. A spike here post-rule-edit means the new rules are passing inputs through unchanged.
- `ecm_normalization_duration_seconds`: histogram of single-call duration. P99 over ~10 ms is a ReDoS smell.
- `ecm_normalization_canary_divergence_total`: SLO-5 SLI numerator. Non-zero is an immediate [canary runbook](runbooks/normalization-canary-divergence.md) trigger.

## Developer reference

### `NormalizationPolicy` dataclass

`backend/normalization_engine.py`:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class NormalizationPolicy:
    unified_enabled: bool = True       # latched from ECM_NORMALIZATION_UNIFIED_POLICY
    confusables_fold: bool = False     # latched from ECM_NORMALIZATION_CONFUSABLES_FOLD (bd-sc5s4)

    def apply_to_text(self, text: str) -> str:
        # Under unified_enabled=True:
        #   1. NFC canonicalize
        #   2. strip whitelisted Cf code points
        #   3. convert superscripts (letters + numerics)
        #   4. (opt-in) confusables fold (Cyrillic/Greek/math/fullwidth -> ASCII)
        # Under unified_enabled=False: only step 3 (legacy behavior)
        # The confusables fold is suppressed under legacy regardless of the flag.
```

The instance is process-global. Read it via `get_default_policy()`; mutate it via the env var + container restart. There is no per-request override.

- `NormalizationEngine.test_rules_batch(texts)`: all-rules multi-input preview.

All three call `get_default_policy().apply_to_text(...)` at the same position at the top of their pipelines. The parity tests in `backend/tests/unit/test_normalization_parity.py` enforce this by fixture sweep; the nightly canary (`backend/scripts/normalization_canary.py`) enforces it end-to-end.

### Metrics (`ecm_normalization_*`)

Defined in `backend/observability.py`:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Purpose |
|-|-|-|-|
| `ecm_normalization_rule_matches_total` | Counter | `rule_category` | Per-category match rate. Per-rule detail goes to sampled INFO log, not metrics, for cardinality. |
| `ecm_normalization_no_change_total` | Counter | None | Count of `normalize()` calls that returned the input unchanged. |
| `ecm_normalization_duration_seconds` | Histogram | None | Per-call duration. Buckets cover sub-millisecond regime. |
| `ecm_normalization_canary_divergence_total` | Counter | None | SLI numerator for SLO-5. Non-zero = breach. |
| `ecm_auto_creation_channels_created_total` | Counter | `normalized ∈ {true, false, skipped}` | Per-Channel-Pipeline outcome. `skipped` = no normalization group on the rule. |

SLO-5 ties the canary counter to zero-tolerance. See [`docs/sre/slos.md` §SLO-5](sre/slos.md#slo-5-normalization-correctness).

### API reference

See [`docs/api.md` §Normalization](api.md#normalization) for the full endpoint list. The endpoints this guide references most often:

- `POST /api/normalization/test`
- `POST /api/normalization/test-batch`
- `POST /api/normalization/normalize`
- `POST /api/normalization/apply-to-channels`: admin-gated, rate-limited 5/minute.
- `GET /api/normalization/lint-findings`: view-only scan of already-saved rules.
