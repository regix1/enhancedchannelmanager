# Notifications & Alert Methods

This index covers the operator workflow end-to-end: configuring each channel and wiring it into scheduled tasks. Per-channel deep dives are linked below and in the Articles table.

## Section purpose

Show operators how to configure ECM's three external notification channels: **Email (SMTP)**, **Discord**, and **Telegram**. Also show how those channels actually get used by **Scheduled Tasks**.

The most common operator question this section answers: *"I enabled email alerts on a scheduled task and nothing arrived. Why?"* The short answer is that two things must both be configured: the channel itself (under **Settings → Notification Settings**), and the task's per-channel toggle (under **Settings → Scheduled Tasks → Edit**). The rest of this page walks through both.

## How alerts get delivered (the short version)

A scheduled task fires an alert (success / warning / error / info). Whether anything reaches an external channel depends on **three independent gates**, evaluated in order:

1. **The task's `send_alerts` master toggle.** If off, no external alert is sent regardless of channel configuration.
2. **The task's per-severity toggle** (`alert_on_success`, `alert_on_warning`, `alert_on_error`, `alert_on_info`). The fired alert's severity must be enabled.
3. **The task's per-channel toggle** (`send_to_email`, `send_to_discord`, `send_to_telegram`) AND the corresponding **Alert Method** must be configured under **Settings → Notification Settings**.

If gate 1 or 2 blocks, nothing is sent anywhere. If gate 3 blocks for a channel, that one channel is skipped; others still fire.

The in-app **Notification Center** (the bell icon) is governed by a separate `show_notifications` toggle on the task; it is independent of the three gates above.

> **Going deeper:** see API reference → Alert Methods ([`docs/api.md`](https://github.com/MotWakorb/enhancedchannelmanager/blob/main/docs/api.md), in the repository, not part of this published guide) for the request/response shapes and API reference → Scheduled Tasks (same file) for the task-update endpoints.

## Settings → Email → Public Base URL

**Set this.** It is the address your operators reach ECM at, and it is what ECM puts into links it emails out. Today that means the password-reset link.

Enter the scheme and host only, with no path: `https://ecm.example.com`, or `http://192.168.1.10:6100` if you reach ECM by IP and port. A trailing slash is accepted and removed for you. A value with a path, a query string, a fragment, or embedded credentials is refused when you save, and so is a value with no `http://` or `https://` in front of it.

While the field is empty, ECM falls back to building reset links from the `Host` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers on the incoming request. Those headers are set by whoever sent the request, not by you, so anyone who knows one of your users' email addresses can make ECM email that user a genuine reset link that points at a host of the attacker's choosing. If the user opens it, their live reset token goes to the attacker. ECM logs a warning at startup while the field is unset.

The **Configured / Not set** badge next to the heading tells you which of the two modes your install is in.

Changing the value is an admin action, like the outbound connection and notification settings. It takes effect on the next reset email; no restart is needed.

## Settings → Notification Settings → SMTP

SMTP is configured **once, globally**. Both M3U Digest reports and per-task email alerts use the same server.

**Required fields:**

| Field | What goes here | Example |
|-|-|-|
| **SMTP Host** | Your provider's outbound server | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| **SMTP Port** | 587 (TLS), 465 (SSL), or 25 (unencrypted) | `587` |
| **Security** | TLS, SSL, or None; TLS is the default | `TLS (STARTTLS)` |
| **Username** | Optional. Usually your full email address | `you@example.com` |
| **Password** | Optional. Use an app password for Gmail / OAuth providers | (kept hidden) |
| **From Email** | The sender address recipients see | `noreply@example.com` |
| **From Name** | Display name in the From header | `ECM Alerts` |

**Verifying it works:**

1. Fill in the SMTP fields above. This page has several save controls: a **Save Recipients** button (for the recipients list below), a page-level **Save Settings** control, and a floating **Save changes** bar. Use the floating **Save changes** bar to save the SMTP fields; it's the verified working path.
2. Scroll to **Test Connection**.
3. Enter a recipient address you control and click **Send Test Email**.
4. A successful test produces a toast that reads *"Test email sent to `<recipient>`"* (for example, "Test email sent to you@example.com") and an email in the destination inbox within a few seconds. The Subject is *"ECM SMTP Test"*.
5. A failed test surfaces the SMTP error verbatim (auth failure, connection refused, TLS handshake error, etc.). Read the error before changing settings.

The **Configured / Unconfigured** badge next to the SMTP heading reflects whether SMTP Host and From Email are both populated. It is independent of whether the test has been run.

## Settings → Notification Settings → Email Alert Recipients

This is where you tell ECM **who receives** scheduled-task email alerts. It is separate from the SMTP server settings above and from the M3U Digest's own recipients list.

> **Why two recipient lists?** The **M3U Digest** has its own recipients field (under **M3U Digest → Email Recipients**) because digests are an opt-in report sent on a digest schedule, often to a different audience than scheduled-task alerts. The list documented here is the one consumed by the **Email** alert channel that scheduled tasks dispatch through.

**To add recipients:**

1. Make sure SMTP (above) is configured first. The hint under the recipients field says so explicitly.
2. Type one or more email addresses in the **Email alert recipients** field. Comma-separated. Pasting a list with semicolons or newlines is normalized to commas automatically.
3. Click **Save Recipients**.

**Validation behavior:**

- Each address is validated against **RFC 5322** at save time. The first invalid address produces an inline error like *"`bad@@example` is not a valid email address. Use a comma-separated list."* Fix it and re-save.
- **Duplicates are removed** automatically. If two addresses normalize to the same value, only one is kept and a toast reports how many were removed, singular- or plural-aware: *"Removed 1 duplicate recipient"* for exactly one, *"Removed N duplicate recipients"* for more than one.
- **Pasted lists** with semicolons (`;`), newlines (`\n`), or carriage returns (`\r`) are normalized to commas at paste time. You can paste from a spreadsheet or another mail client without manual cleanup.
- Whitespace around addresses is trimmed.

**Verifying it works:**

The **Configured / Unconfigured** badge next to the *Email Alert Recipients* heading turns green once at least one recipient is saved. The empty-state hint disappears. A *"Saved at HH:MM"* timestamp confirms the last save.

> **Note:** there is no "send a test alert email" button on the recipients section. The Send Test Email button up in SMTP Configuration only exercises the SMTP server, not the recipients list. To verify recipients end-to-end, run a scheduled task manually (Settings → Scheduled Tasks → Run Now) with a non-empty result and confirm the email arrives.

## Settings → Notification Settings → Discord Webhook

Discord uses an **incoming webhook URL**: no bot, no API key, no OAuth.

**To get the webhook URL from Discord:**

1. In Discord, open the server you want alerts to post to.
2. **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook**.
3. Choose the destination channel and copy the **Webhook URL**. The URL looks like `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<id>/<token>`.

Paste it into the **Webhook URL** field in **Settings → Notification Settings → Discord Webhook** and save.

**Verifying it works:** click **Send Test Message**. A successful test posts a short test message to the configured Discord channel and surfaces a success toast. Failures surface the Discord API error verbatim: most commonly *"Unknown Webhook"* (URL is wrong or the webhook was deleted).

The webhook URL is shared across **all** features that use Discord: M3U Digest, scheduled-task alerts, etc. There is no per-feature webhook.

## Settings → Notification Settings → Telegram Bot

Telegram requires two pieces of information: a **bot token** and a **chat ID**.

**To get the bot token:**

1. In Telegram, open a chat with **@BotFather**.
2. `/newbot` and follow the prompts (name and username for the bot).
3. BotFather replies with the **bot token**: a long string like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz...`. Copy it.

**To get the chat ID:**

- For a **personal chat**, message **@userinfobot** or **@RawDataBot**. They reply with your numeric chat ID.
- For a **group**, add the bot to the group, then use **@RawDataBot** or the Telegram API's `getUpdates` to read the group's chat ID. Group chat IDs are **negative numbers** (e.g., `-1001234567890`).

Paste the token into **Bot Token** and the chat ID into **Chat ID**, then save.

**Verifying it works:** click **Send Test Message**. A successful test posts a test message to the chat and surfaces a success toast. The most common failure is *"chat not found"* (bot is not in the group, or chat ID is wrong) or *"unauthorized"* (token is wrong).

## Settings → Notification Settings → Alert Methods

Below the SMTP, Discord Webhook, and Telegram Bot sections, the **Alert
Methods** list shows every alert method those settings have created, one row
per method: its name, its type badge (**Email (SMTP)**, **Discord**,
**Telegram**), an **Enabled/Disabled** badge, a send icon (sends a test
message to that method) and a delete icon. When no alert methods exist yet,
it reads *"No alert methods configured yet. Configure SMTP, Discord, or
Telegram above to create one."*

> **This list does not live-update.** Saving the Discord Webhook or the
> Telegram Bot creates or updates the underlying alert method immediately on
> the backend, but the Alert Methods list on the same page keeps showing its
> previous state, including "No alert methods configured yet," until you
> reload the page. **Email works differently:** saving SMTP settings alone
> does not create the Email (SMTP) alert method. The row appears only after
> you've also saved at least one address in Email Alert Recipients, and then
> reloaded the page. Reload after saving a channel for the first time to see
> its row (and the send/delete icons) appear.

## How scheduled tasks dispatch external alerts

Each scheduled task has its own copy of the four notify-on-* gates and the three per-channel toggles. They live on the task, not on the alert method.

**Per-task settings (Settings → Scheduled Tasks → Edit task):**

| Setting | What it controls |
|-|-|
| `send_alerts` | Master switch. Off = no external alert is ever sent for this task. |
| `alert_on_success` | Send alerts for successful runs. |
| `alert_on_warning` | Send alerts when the task completes with warnings. |
| `alert_on_error` | Send alerts when the task fails. |
| `alert_on_info` | Send informational alerts (rare; default off). |
| `send_to_email` | Use the Email alert channel for this task's alerts. Requires SMTP + at least one recipient. |
| `send_to_discord` | Use the Discord alert channel. Requires Discord Webhook configured. |
| `send_to_telegram` | Use the Telegram alert channel. Requires Telegram Bot configured. |
| `show_notifications` | Show alerts in the in-app Notification Center (independent of the external channels). |

**Decision flow at fire time:**

```
task fires alert (severity=error, say)
  │
  ├─ send_alerts? ───── no ──> stop (no external dispatch)
  │
  ├─ alert_on_error? ── no ──> stop
  │
  ├─ for each channel where send_to_<channel> is true:
  │     ├─ Email    → resolved via Email Alert Recipients (above)
  │     ├─ Discord  → resolved via Discord Webhook (above)
  │     └─ Telegram → resolved via Telegram Bot (above)
  │
  └─ show_notifications? ── yes ──> also append to Notification Center
```

**Common reasons an alert isn't delivered:**

1. The task's `send_alerts` master toggle is off. (Check first: it's the most common silent block.)
2. The task's per-severity toggle for the fired severity is off. *Success alerts especially are often disabled by default to reduce noise.*
3. The per-channel toggle is on, but the channel itself is **Unconfigured** (badge is grey). Configure the channel under Notification Settings.
4. **Email-specific:** SMTP is configured but the **Email Alert Recipients** list is empty. The hint under the recipients field warns about this; the toast/notification on save also calls it out.
5. The destination provider rejected the message. This surfaces in the backend logs as `[ALERTS-SMTP]`, `[ALERTS-DISCORD]`, or `[ALERTS-TELEGRAM]` warnings/errors. Check the logs (see [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/index.md)) when channels are configured but alerts still go missing.
