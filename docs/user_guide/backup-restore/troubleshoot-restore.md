# Troubleshoot a Restore

---

## "Unsupported backup version"

**Symptom:** The upload step shows "Unsupported backup version" and the restore is refused.

**Cause:** The artifact was produced by a newer ECM build than the one currently running. The schema version inside the artifact is higher than this build supports.

**Fix:** Upgrade ECM to at least the version that produced the backup. Alternatively, if you have an older backup that is still usable, restore from that instead.

---

## "Backup integrity check failed"

**Symptom:** The upload step fails with "Backup integrity check failed."

**Cause:** One or more files inside the artifact do not match their SHA-256 hashes recorded in `manifest.json`. The artifact may have been corrupted during transit, partially overwritten, or tampered with.

**Fix:**
1. Download the artifact again from its original source.
2. If you have the `.sha256` sidecar, verify the artifact locally: `sha256sum -c ecm-backup-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.zip.sha256`.
3. If the artifact is corrupt, restore from an earlier backup.

---

## "Could not decrypt artifact: wrong passphrase or corrupted artifact"

**Symptom:** After entering a passphrase for an encrypted backup, the restore is refused with this message.

**Cause:** Either the passphrase is wrong, or the encrypted artifact is corrupted. ECM returns the same message for both cases. This is intentional (no oracle).

**Fix:**
1. Double-check the passphrase. Passphrases are case-sensitive.
2. If you are confident the passphrase is correct, the artifact may be corrupted. Verify the `.sha256` sidecar if available.
3. If the passphrase is lost: there is no recovery path. The encrypted artifact is permanently unrecoverable. Restore from an unencrypted backup, or from a different encrypted backup for which you have the passphrase.

---

## "Pre-flight refused: ..."

**Symptom:** The restore is refused at the pre-flight stage with one or more problem messages.

Pre-flight runs before any mutation. If it fails, nothing was changed.

Common pre-flight failures:

| Problem kind | Meaning | Fix |
|-|-|-|
| `unsupported_schema_version` | Artifact schema version is unsupported (same as above). | Upgrade ECM. |
| `unresolved_fk_reference` | A channel references a channel group or stream profile that is not in the archive and does not already exist on the destination. | Restore the channel groups and stream profiles first, or include them in the same restore. |
| `duplicate_unique_name` | The archive contains two M3U accounts, channel groups, or channel profiles with the same name. | The archive is malformed. Contact support if this was produced by ECM's own backup tool. |
| `count_out_of_bounds` | A category has an implausibly large number of entities (above the sanity ceiling). | The archive may be malformed or from an untrusted source. |

## A logo entry reports failed, not the whole restore

**Symptom:** The restore-complete report shows a logo entry with
`failed=1` or a nonzero `logo_misses`, alongside a normal
`outcome: completed` (or `completed_with_failures`) for the rest of the
restore.

**Cause:** A logo uploaded through ECM's own Logo Manager (as opposed to
one auto-assigned from an M3U or EPG feed) is written to **Dispatcharr's**
storage, not ECM's own upload directory. If that logo's bytes could not
be fetched from Dispatcharr's own logo cache endpoint at backup time, the
backup does not have anything to restore it from. Logos referenced by a
remote http(s) URL are unaffected; this only happens for logos uploaded
through ECM's own Logo Manager.

**Fix:** A logo failure is a non-fatal restore category: it is counted
and named in the report, and the rest of the restore completes normally.
See [Logo misses: red banner after restore](#logo-misses-red-banner-after-restore)
below for what to do next.

---

## Playback fails after a redacted restore

**Symptom:** You restored a standard (redacted) backup. Restored channels
will not play, and their stream lists show the provider **ECM Custom
Streams (DBAS restore)** instead of your real provider.

**Cause:** A standard artifact replaces the structured provider credential
fields and credential-bearing URLs, so at the
moment the restore reattaches channels to real streams there are no real
streams to attach to: the M3U account cannot authenticate yet. Every
channel is parked on a URL-less placeholder instead. Immediately after a
redacted restore this is the expected state, not a defect.

**Fix: re-enter the credential and refresh. That is the whole
recovery.**

1. Go to **Settings → M3U Accounts** and enter the real password on every
   account the restore report (or the post-restore panel) names as
   needing one.
2. Refresh that account, with **Save & Refresh** or the account's own
   **Refresh** action.

When that refresh completes, ECM re-runs the reattach pass over the
streams it has just materialized, moves each channel off its placeholder
onto the real stream, and then deletes the leftover placeholders and the
synthetic **ECM Custom Streams (DBAS restore)** account behind it. Only
placeholders ECM itself created are ever touched. A custom stream you
created yourself is never rebound and never removed.

!!! note "Which refresh actions trigger the reattach"
    **Covered:** the **Refresh** action on an individual M3U account, and
    the scheduled M3U refresh task.

    **Not covered:** a "refresh all accounts" action, and a refresh
    performed in Dispatcharr's own UI. Neither reports completion back to
    ECM in a way the reattach can hang on, so an instance that reached
    real streams by one of those routes is picked up on the **next
    scheduled M3U refresh** rather than immediately. If you used one of
    those and your channels are still on placeholders, refresh the
    individual account and they will rebind straight away.

See [Step 6 of Migrate to a new install](migrate-to-a-new-install.md#step-6-re-enter-credentials-standard-backup-only)
for the same sequence walked through end to end.

An encrypted artifact with **Include credentials** needs none of this.
The credential round-trips with the artifact and playback works on the
first restore.

If a channel is still on a placeholder after a completed refresh of its
own M3U account, see
[A restored channel is still on the ECM Custom Streams provider](#a-restored-channel-is-still-on-the-ecm-custom-streams-provider)
below.

## A restored channel is still on the ECM Custom Streams provider

**Symptom:** One channel's stream list shows the provider **ECM Custom
Streams (DBAS restore)** instead of your real provider. There are two
shapes of this, and only one of them is an outage:

- **The channel plays.** It kept its real streams and is holding one
  leftover placeholder in one slot. The report counts it under
  `channels_needing_stream_reattach` and names it in
  `stream_reattach_details` with `has_playable_stream: true`. This is
  untidy, not broken, and it never on its own stops the restore reporting
  success. (The run can still report **completed with failures** for a
  different reason — a channel that cannot play at all, a stream whose
  address lost its credentials, a channel that arrived without its guide
  link, or a logo that could not be reinstated. A leftover placeholder on
  a channel that plays is not one of them.)
- **The channel errors on playback.** Nothing on it is a real stream.
  The report counts it under "channel(s) have NO playable stream"
  (`channels_with_no_playable_stream`), names it in
  `stream_reattach_details` with `has_playable_stream: false`, and the
  restore reports `completed_with_failures` rather than success.

**Cause of the leftover placeholder (the channel plays):** When ECM
reattaches a restored channel to real streams, it matches each archived
stream by name. A channel cannot hold the same stream twice, so if two
archived streams on one channel resolve to the **same** real stream, ECM
gives that stream to the first slot which claimed it and leaves the second
slot on its placeholder. The collision costs one slot rather than the
whole channel.

This only happens when two archived streams on the same channel have
names that are **genuinely identical**. No per-stream name match can
tell those apart, so one of them must lose its slot. Matching prefers a
destination stream whose name is character-for-character identical to
the archived one, so two streams that differ only in case, such as
`TX | Dallas | PBS KERA` and `TX | DALLAS | PBS KERA`, resolve to the
two distinct streams that actually exist and the channel restores
complete, in its archived order.

**Cause of a channel that will not play:** every one of its slots is a
placeholder, so there is nothing to stream. That happens when nothing on
the destination matched any of the channel's archived streams (most
often because the provider's streams had not materialized yet, or the
names moved too far from the archive to match), or when the update that
would have reattached the channel failed upstream and left every slot as
it was. The report names these channels specifically; they are the ones
worth acting on first.

**Fix:** Reattach that channel's streams by hand. This is a one-time
per-channel repair:

1. Open Channel Manager and find the channel the report named.
2. Remove the streams showing the **ECM Custom Streams (DBAS restore)** provider.
3. Add the real streams back from your provider, in the order you want.
4. Play the channel to confirm.

Before you re-run a restore to fix one channel, refresh that channel's
own M3U account first. A completed refresh of an individual account
re-runs the reattach pass by itself, which is cheaper and safer than a
second restore. Re-running the restore is worth trying only for a
channel that will not play, and only once the real streams are actually
present on the destination.

Either way the channel is a named action item, never a `failed` row, and
every other channel is unaffected. There is no need to redo the whole
restore.

Prevention: on the source instance, give identically-named streams on the
same channel distinguishable names before taking the backup. This prevents
the leftover placeholder, which is an annoyance rather than an outage. A
channel that will not play at all has a different cause and is not
prevented by renaming.

## A clean report is not proof of playback

**Symptom:** The report says the run finished cleanly. Most channels play.
One does not.

**The durable advice:** a restore report tells you what ECM believes it
did, not what your instance can stream. Before you call any restore done,
actually play a channel: fetch the stream and confirm you get both a 2xx
status and real media bytes, not merely that a URL field is populated.
When something is wrong, read the per-category `failed` rows as well as
the summary counters, and check Dispatcharr's own log for the underlying
cause. Summary counters are a starting point, never the verdict.

The "channels needing attention" counters
(`channels_needing_stream_reattach`, `channels_with_no_playable_stream`)
reflect every restored channel, from what it is actually left holding,
regardless of which restore run put it there. If a name-collision case
is hiding a stream conflict, see
[A restored channel is still on the ECM Custom Streams provider](#a-restored-channel-is-still-on-the-ecm-custom-streams-provider)
above.

## What a preview can and cannot tell you about stream health

**Symptom:** You want to know, before you commit, whether the restore will
leave channels unable to play. The preview's stream-health counters do not
answer that question.

**How to read a preview:**

| What the preview reports | How far to trust it |
|-|-|
| Per-category `would_create` / `would_update` / `would_skip` | Accurate. Measured against a matching apply, these matched exactly, category by category. |
| `logo_reattach` and `epg_link_reattach` splits | Predicted, and they match the apply. |
| `profile_membership_drift` | Predicted, and it matches the apply exactly. |
| `channels_needing_stream_reattach`, `channels_with_no_playable_stream` and `stream_urls_redacted` | **Not predicted.** All three read `null` on a dry run. |

**What `null` means here.** These three counters are written by the pass
that reattaches channels to real provider streams, and that pass matches
against streams the restore's own deferred M3U refresh materializes. A
preview performs no refresh, so it has nothing to look at. `null` says
exactly that: this number is not knowable before the apply. Read it as
"not predicted", never as "zero channels need attention".

On a **populated** target, the preview's splits are exact in both relink
modes: preserve mode (keeps a channel's own existing EPG link and logo)
and overwrite mode (replaces them with the archive's values). The same
two relink modes also govern a channel's **group**, not just its EPG
link and logo: preserve reads *"Keep their current guide data, logos,
and grouping"* and overwrite reads *"Replace their guide data, logos,
and grouping with the backup's"*, and the resulting channel-group drift
count is itself predicted on the preview. See
[Restoring onto an already-populated
target](#restoring-onto-an-already-populated-target) below for what
each relink mode does.

**Fix:** Preview to confirm scope. Verify stream health, and actual
playback, after the apply completes.

---

## Restoring onto an already-populated target

**Symptom:** You restore onto a Dispatcharr instance that already has
channels (a second restore, or a restore onto a live instance), and you
want to know what the restore does to a channel whose current group,
logo, or EPG link differs from the archive's.

**What happens:** A restore onto a populated target accepts a relink
mode governing how that divergence is handled:

- **`preserve` (the default).** Every channel whose current group
  differs from the archive's is reported as channel-group drift,
  naming the channel, its current group, and the group the archive
  assigns it. Nothing is moved. The channel's own logo and EPG link are
  left alone too.
- **`overwrite`.** The same divergence is reported, and the channel is
  actually moved into the archive's group, with its logo and EPG link
  replaced by the archive's values.

The drift count is predicted on the dry-run preview, before either mode
is applied, so you can see what `overwrite` is about to do to your
lineup before committing to it.

**Fix:** Stay on `preserve` if you do not want any channel's grouping,
logo, or EPG link touched. Choose `overwrite`, and expect the reported
drift count of channels to move, if you want your lineup to match the
archive exactly. Either way, read the drift count on the preview before
you pick a mode, and read it again in the restore-complete report
afterward.

## The restore ran but channels look wrong

**Symptom:** The restore reported success, but channel numbers are wrong, channels are missing, or streams are not playing.

**Check 1: Stream matching tiers.** The restore-complete report shows how many streams were matched at each tier (exact URL, exact name+provider, exact normalized name, fuzzy name). A large number of Tier-4 fuzzy matches or misses means ECM had trouble re-attaching streams from the archive to the streams on this Dispatcharr instance. This happens most often when the M3U provider's stream URLs have changed significantly, or when restoring onto an instance with different M3U accounts.

**Fix for stream misses:** Check that the M3U accounts on the destination instance are configured and active, then refresh each account so all streams are present. A completed refresh of an individual account also reattaches any channel still holding a placeholder, so check playback before doing anything else. If channels are still short of streams after that, re-attempt the restore: the stream matcher will have more candidates to match against.

**Check 2: Did the M3U accounts restore first?** If you ran a partial restore that included channels but excluded M3U accounts, channels cannot be attached to their providers. Restore M3U accounts first, then restore channels.

**Check 3: Channel number conflicts.** The restore reports a `CONFLICT` (failed with reason) for a channel when the channel has no channel number and an existing channel with the same name and no number is already present. This is ambiguous. ECM cannot determine if they are the same channel or two different ones. The second channel is not created. Assign explicit channel numbers on the source before re-taking the backup to avoid this.

## The restore failed part-way: "restore failed, state rolled back"

**Symptom:** The restore-complete screen shows "restore failed, state rolled back."

**What happened:** A failure occurred mid-restore (a Dispatcharr API error, a timeout, or a validation error). ECM ran a compensating rollback: every entity created during this restore run was deleted in reverse order. The instance is back to its pre-restore state.

**Fix:** Investigate the failure reason shown in the report (it appears in the notes section). Common causes:
- Dispatcharr API returned an error for a specific entity (name conflict, validation failure). Check the Dispatcharr logs.
- Network timeout between ECM and Dispatcharr. Check connectivity and retry.

After resolving the underlying cause, re-run the restore from scratch.

---

## The restore failed: "rollback incomplete"

**Symptom:** The restore-complete screen shows "restore failed, rollback incomplete."

**What happened:** A failure occurred mid-restore AND the compensating rollback could not delete one or more entities (the delete returned an error that was not 404). The instance is in a partially modified state. The report lists the entity IDs and types that could not be rolled back.

**This is the worst outcome. Take it seriously.** The instance state is indeterminate. Some entities from the backup are present, others are not. Do not attempt another restore until you have cleaned up the residue.

**Fix:**
1. Read the report. Note every entity type and destination ID listed as residue.
2. Log into the Dispatcharr UI (or use the Dispatcharr API) and manually delete each listed entity.
3. Confirm the entities are gone.
4. Take a fresh backup of the current state.
5. Re-attempt the restore.

If you are on a fresh install and the instance has no channels you care about, a simpler recovery is: delete all channels and M3U accounts via the Dispatcharr UI, then re-run the restore from scratch.

---

## Logo misses: red banner after restore

**Symptom:** After a successful restore, a red banner shows "N logos could not be matched."

**What happened:** One or more logo files in the archive did not match any existing logo on the destination. The channels exist and work. Only the logos are affected.

**Fix:** Re-upload the missing logos manually in the Dispatcharr UI, or re-run an EPG logo match if your EPG sources carry logo URLs.

---

## Checking logs

ECM logs all restore activity at the `[DBAS-RESTORE]` log prefix. For detailed diagnostics:

```bash
docker logs ecm-ecm-1 2>&1 | grep "\[DBAS"
```

The logs contain entity types, IDs, and outcome codes, but never credentials or passphrase values.

The restore ledger is stored at `/config/dbas/restore_ledger_<id>.json` while a restore is in progress, and deleted on clean success. If a ledger file remains after a failed restore, it records the exact entities that were created and (if rollback was incomplete) which ones remain.
