# Settings

> **Status:** Navigation rewritten 2026-07. Settings is now drill-in navigation with six grouped destinations, replacing a flat list of 18 (now 17; Lookup Tables was retired the same week; see [Where did Lookup Tables go?](#where-did-lookup-tables-go) below). This section documents the shipped navigation and the destinations in scoped batches; see the [Articles](#articles) table for what has shipped.

Settings is where an operator configures everything that isn't a day-to-day
channel-management task: the Dispatcharr connection, how channels get
created and cleaned up, where notifications go, recurring maintenance, and
(for admins) authentication and access control.

## How Settings navigation works

Settings is not a page. It's a destination with 17 sub-pages reached
through **drill-in navigation**. This changed recently; if you've read an
older description that says "scroll down the Settings page" or lists a flat
menu of destinations, it's out of date. Here's what's actually there:

1. **Click Settings** in the primary sidebar (bottom of the System group).
   The sidebar itself changes: the primary destinations (Dashboard, M3U
   Manager, Channel Pipeline, and so on) are replaced by a **Back** control
   and six grouped headings, each listing the Settings destinations under it.
2. **The groups, in order:** Connections, Channel Processing, Notifications
   & Reports, Upkeep, Workspace, and (for admins only) Administration. A
   group heading with nothing under it (Administration, for a non-admin
   viewer) simply doesn't render; there's no empty section to scroll past.
3. **Click any destination** in the sidebar to load that settings page. The
   page heading becomes a three-part breadcrumb
   (`SYSTEM / SETTINGS / <PAGE NAME>`), and the sidebar stays drilled in, so
   you can jump straight to the next destination without leaving Settings.
4. **Back returns the sidebar to the main destinations list. It does not
   navigate you away from the settings page you're viewing.** This trips
   people up once: clicking Back collapses the drill-in and shows Dashboard,
   M3U Manager, etc. again, but the page you were reading (say, Maintenance)
   is still on screen until you click a different primary destination.
5. **On longer pages, a second navigation rail appears on the right: "On
   this page."** Any settings page with two or more sections gets one; a
   single-section page (Tags, Linked Accounts, Backup & Restore) does not.
   Clicking an entry scrolls to that section and updates the URL with a
   `?section=` anchor, so you can bookmark or share a link straight to one
   section of a long page (useful for Maintenance, which has nine).

At the minimum supported viewport (1280×720), the grouped destination list
is taller than the visible sidebar and **scrolls internally**. Back stays
pinned at the top while you scroll to reach Workspace or Administration.

Workspace and Administration are further down; the list scrolls internally at 1280×720.](../../images/user_guide/settings/1-settings-navigation-groups.png)

Here's a full page with the drill-in sidebar, the three-part breadcrumb, and
the "On this page" rail all visible together (Channel Defaults, chosen
because it has no sensitive data to redact):

## A note on "Security"

There is no longer a Settings → Security destination. Its one control (the
allowlist governing which network destinations ECM may send backups to)
was folded into **Backup & Restore → Where backups can be sent**. A
bookmarked `#settings/security` link still resolves there automatically. If
you're looking for that control, see [Backup & Restore](../backup-restore/index.md).

## Where did Lookup Tables go?

Lookup Tables was removed as a Settings destination. If you ever used it,
read [Lookup Tables retired: export before you upgrade](../epg/lookup-tables-retired.md)
before you upgrade past the release that removed it. There's a data export
step. A bookmarked `#settings/lookup-tables` link resolves to General.

Three destinations in the live navigation aren't covered by a new article
here because they already have a home elsewhere in the user guide. See the
[Start here](#start-here) table: **Integrations** ([Media Server
Integrations](../integrations/index.md)), **Notification Settings**
([Notifications & Alert Methods](../notifications/index.md)), and **Channel
Pipeline** settings ([Channel Pipeline](../channel-pipeline/index.md)).
**Backup & Restore** likewise already has a full, exemplary section at
[`../backup-restore/`](../backup-restore/index.md). This page links to it
rather than duplicating it.
