# Authentication

> **Admin only.** This destination only appears in the Settings navigation for administrators; it does not render for non-admin operators.

Authentication, under **Administration** in the Settings navigation,
controls instance-wide login requirements and which sign-in providers are
available: local username/password, and Dispatcharr SSO.

## Common tasks

### Require login for every operator

1. Go to **Settings → Authentication**.
2. Under **Global Settings**, check **Require Authentication**. When this
   is off, the application runs in open mode, with no login required for
   anyone.
3. Save.

**Result:** Anyone reaching ECM is now prompted to sign in before they can
use it.

### Turn on local username/password sign-in

1. Go to **Settings → Authentication**.
2. Under **Local Authentication**, check **Enable local authentication**.
3. Set **Minimum Password Length** (6–32 characters).
4. Save.

**Result:** Operators can now sign in with a local username and password
meeting the configured minimum length. Create and manage those accounts
under [User Management](user-management.md).

### Let operators sign in with their Dispatcharr credentials

1. Confirm the Dispatcharr URL is set correctly under [General
   Settings](general-settings.md) first. Dispatcharr SSO uses that same
   URL.
2. Go to **Settings → Authentication**.
3. Under **Dispatcharr SSO**, check **Enable Dispatcharr SSO**. This
   allows users to sign in using their Dispatcharr credentials.
4. Save.

**Result:** A Dispatcharr-credential sign-in option becomes available
alongside (or instead of) local authentication, depending on what else you
have enabled. When both are enabled, a returning operator sees a provider
selector on the sign-in screen and picks **Local Account** or
**Dispatcharr** before entering credentials. With only one provider enabled,
that provider's sign-in form is shown directly and there's no selector to
pick from. Sessions renew themselves with an automatic token refresh, so a
signed-in operator isn't dropped back to the sign-in screen mid-session.

### Reset a forgotten local password

This only applies to local accounts. A Dispatcharr SSO account's password is
managed in Dispatcharr, not here.

**Via email**, if SMTP is configured (see [Notifications & Alert
Methods](../notifications/index.md#settings-notification-settings-smtp)).
Set the [Public Base
URL](../notifications/index.md#settings-email-public-base-url) first: it is
the address the emailed link points at, and while it is unset that address
comes from headers on the incoming request rather than from your
configuration, which lets someone who knows an operator's email address aim
that operator's reset link at a host they control. Then:

1. On the local sign-in form, select **Forgot password?**.
2. Enter the account's **Email Address** and select **Send Reset Link**.
3. Open the emailed link, enter **New Password** and **Confirm Password**,
   then select **Reset Password**. The link is valid for one hour.

**Via the command line**, when an operator is locked out or SMTP isn't
configured:

```bash
# Interactive mode: lists users, prompts for everything
docker exec -it ecm-ecm-1 python /app/reset_password.py

# Non-interactive: specify username and password
docker exec ecm-ecm-1 python /app/reset_password.py -u admin -p 'NewPass123'

# Semi-interactive: specify username, prompt for password securely
docker exec -it ecm-ecm-1 python /app/reset_password.py -u admin

# Skip password strength validation
docker exec ecm-ecm-1 python /app/reset_password.py -u admin -p 'simple' --force
```

Interactive mode prints a table of every user with their username, email,
admin status, active status, and auth provider, so you can confirm you're
resetting the right account before you type a new password. Substitute your
own container name if it isn't `ecm-ecm-1`.

The command line applies the same password rules as the web UI: at least 8
characters, not a known common or breached password, and not containing the
username. There are no uppercase, lowercase or digit requirements. If it
refuses a password it prints those rules, and `--force` skips the check
entirely.
