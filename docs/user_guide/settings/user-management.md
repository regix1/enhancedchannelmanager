# User Management

> **Admin only.** This destination only appears in the Settings navigation for administrators; it does not render for non-admin operators.

User Management, under **Administration** in the Settings navigation, lists
every user account (username, email, sign-in provider, status, and role)
with Edit and Delete actions per row, plus a summary of active vs. inactive
accounts.

## Common tasks

### Create a user account

Account creation on this page requires **local authentication** to be
enabled first. See [Authentication](authentication.md).

1. Go to **Settings → User Management**.
2. Create the new account, setting its username, role, and initial
   password.

**Result:** The new account appears in the list with status Active, and
the active-account count increases by one.

### Change a user's role

1. Go to **Settings → User Management**.
2. Click **Edit** on the user's row.
3. Change their role.
4. Save.

**Result:** The Role column for that user updates immediately, and their
permissions change on their next request.

### Deactivate a user without deleting their account

1. Go to **Settings → User Management**.
2. Click **Edit** on the user's row.
3. Set their status to inactive.
4. Save.

**Result:** The user's Status shows inactive and they can no longer sign
in, but their account (and any history tied to it) is preserved. Use
**Delete** instead only if you actually want the account gone.

You can't deactivate or delete the account you're currently signed in with.
ECM disables both actions on your own row so you can't accidentally lock
yourself out.
