# Lookup Tables retired: export before you upgrade

> **TL;DR:** If that page has any rows, **export them before you upgrade.** The
> upgrade drops the `lookup_tables` database table and the rows are not
> restored by rolling the migration back. Your generated EPG output does **not**
> change. The `{key|lookup:<table>}` pipe never worked in generated XMLTV in
> the first place.

## Does this affect me?

Ask the running instance, **before** you upgrade:

```bash
curl -s http://YOUR-ECM-HOST:6100/api/lookup-tables
```

- `[]`: nothing to do. Upgrade normally.
- Anything else: you have tables. **Export them now**, then upgrade.

Or open **Settings → Lookup Tables** and look at the list.

## Export your tables (do this first)

The list endpoint returns summaries without entries, so fetch each table by id
to get its `entries` dict:

```bash
HOST=http://YOUR-ECM-HOST:6100
curl -s "$HOST/api/lookup-tables" -o lookup-tables-index.json
for id in $(python3 -c "import json;print(*[t['id'] for t in json.load(open('lookup-tables-index.json'))])"); do
  curl -s "$HOST/api/lookup-tables/$id" -o "lookup-table-$id.json"
done
```

If authentication is enabled, add your session cookie or bearer token the same
way you would for any other ECM API call.

There is no import path back into ECM. The feature is gone. Keep the JSON as a
record of your key→value mappings so you can fold them into your templates by
hand (see [What to do instead](#what-to-do-instead)).

## Safety net if you forget

The migration is not silent. Before dropping the table it writes every row it
is about to delete to a JSON file **beside your database**:

```
/config/lookup_tables_dropped_0041.json
```

and logs the path at `WARNING` in the container log:

```
docker logs ecm-ecm-1 2>&1 | grep '\[0041\]'
```

Two caveats: nothing in ECM reads that file (copy it somewhere you keep), and
the dump is best-effort. If `/config` is read-only or full, the log line says
the dump failed and the rows were deleted anyway. It is a safety net, not a
backup. Your pre-upgrade export or your DBAS/ZIP backup is the backup.

## What actually changes

| Surface | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| **Settings → Lookup Tables** | A Settings destination under Channel Processing | Gone. A bookmarked `#settings/lookup-tables` URL lands on **Settings → General** |
| `{key\|lookup:<table>}` in a template | Resolved in **preview** only | Unknown transform: the field renders the raw template text |
| Generated XMLTV for such a template | Already rendered the raw template text | **Unchanged** |
| `/api/lookup-tables` (5 endpoints) | Available | Removed (`404`) |
| `inline_lookups` / `global_lookup_ids` on `POST /api/dummy-epg/preview` | Merged into the render | Ignored (a stale cached browser tab keeps working, it just stops resolving) |
| `lookup_tables` database table | Present | Dropped (Alembic revision `0041`) |

## Why it was removed rather than fixed

The pipe only ever worked in **preview**. Two code paths resolved lookup
tables (`POST /api/dummy-epg/preview` and `POST /api/dummy-epg/preview/batch`),
and neither is the path that produces your actual EPG. XMLTV generation
called the render helper without a lookups dict, so the engine raised
"unknown lookup table", the surrounding fallback swallowed it, and the **raw
template text was emitted verbatim** as the programme title or description:

```xml
<title>{away|lookup:teams} at {home}</title>
```

So an operator who used the pipe saw a correct preview and garbage in the
guide. Keeping the pipe would have meant documenting that trap permanently;
removing it makes preview agree with what is actually generated. That is the
one behaviour change you may notice: a template using the pipe now previews
the same raw text your EPG was already showing.

## What to do instead

The mappings a lookup table held are almost always expressible with the pipes
that remain, none of which were touched:

- `{name|replace:<from>:<to>}`: a small fixed substitution, chainable.
- **Substitution pairs** on the profile: applied to the source name before
  pattern matching, and the right place for provider-name cleanup.
- **Pattern variants**: when different name shapes need different templates.
- [Channel Normalization](../normalization/index.md): for renaming at the
  channel level rather than in the EPG template.

Full remaining syntax: [Dummy EPG Template
Engine](https://github.com/MotWakorb/enhancedchannelmanager/blob/main/docs/template_engine.md).

## Rolling back

`alembic downgrade 0040` recreates the `lookup_tables` table and its index, so
the schema is fully reversible, but the table comes back **empty**. There is
no down migration that restores the rows. To get the data back you need the
JSON dump above, your pre-upgrade export, or a backup taken before the
upgrade.
