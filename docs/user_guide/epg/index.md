# EPG

## Section purpose

Cover the EPG Manager page and EPG-related settings: adding EPG sources, how ECM matches channels to EPG entries, refresh schedules, and the dummy EPG template engine for channels without upstream EPG data.

## Channel-to-EPG matching

Linking a channel to a guide entry is a separate step from adding a source.
See the full walkthrough, including confidence-score guidance and
timezone/region-aware ranking, at [Match channels to EPG
data](channel-to-epg-matching.md).

## Dummy EPG

For channels with no upstream guide data at all, ECM can generate listings
from channel/stream names instead of pulling them from a provider. See
[Dummy EPG overview](dummy-epg-overview.md) and [Author dummy EPG
templates](dummy-epg-templates.md).
