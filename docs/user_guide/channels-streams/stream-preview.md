# Preview Streams and Channels in the Browser

Before you assign a stream to a channel, or after you've built one, you can
play it back right in ECM without opening an external player. This article
covers the preview modal itself: what it plays, the three playback modes, and
the alternative actions inside it. For the row-level buttons that open it, see
[Streams](streams-overview.md#inspect-a-single-stream).

## Common tasks

### Preview a single stream before you assign it

1. On an assigned stream row, or a row in the Streams panel, click **Preview
   stream in browser** (the `visibility` icon).
2. The preview modal opens with an embedded video player and the stream's
   metadata: name, TVG-ID, group, and M3U provider.

**Result:** You can confirm a stream is actually alive, at the quality you
expect, before spending time building a channel around it. The adjacent
**Open in VLC** button (`play_circle`) launches VLC instead of playing in the
browser; it does not open this modal.

Raw stream previews and stream probes connect to the provider directly from
the ECM container. They do not inherit Dispatcharr's network namespace or VPN
route. If a provider works in Dispatcharr but its raw preview or probe times
out in ECM, attach ECM to the same VPN/routed Docker network (or add an
equivalent route from ECM). Do not copy provider URLs into support reports;
they commonly contain credentials. Dispatcharr does not expose a supported
raw-stream-by-ID proxy for ECM to use without changing channel state.

### Preview a channel's actual output

1. Open the channel's **Channel actions** menu and select **Preview**.

**Result:** Unlike a raw stream preview, this tests the real Dispatcharr proxy
output for that channel, end to end, the same URL a media client would
connect to. Use this once a channel has streams assigned, when you want to
confirm the whole path works, not just the source stream.

### Choose which playback mode the preview uses

The preview modal shows a mode indicator naming the current playback mode.
That mode comes from **Settings → Appearance → Browser Playback Mode** (see
[Appearance](../settings/appearance.md#choose-how-open-in-vlc-and-browser-stream-preview-behave)):

| Mode | Behavior |
|-|-|
| **Passthrough** | Direct proxy, fastest, but can fail on AC-3/E-AC-3/DTS audio the browser can't decode. |
| **Transcode** | FFmpeg transcodes audio to AAC for browser compatibility. Recommended default; costs backend CPU. |
| **Video Only** | Strips audio entirely, for a quick silent check that the video itself is alive. |

**Result:** Changing the setting takes effect on the next preview you open;
it does not affect a preview already playing.

### Use the modal's other actions

From the preview modal you can also:

- **Open in VLC**: launch the same stream in VLC media player instead of the
  in-browser player.
- **Download M3U**: download a one-line M3U playlist file pointing at the
  stream, useful for handing off to another player.
- **Copy URL**: copy the direct stream URL to your clipboard.

> Stream URLs usually carry your provider's credentials as query parameters.
> Treat anything you copy here as a secret.
