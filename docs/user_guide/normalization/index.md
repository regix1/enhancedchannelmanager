# Normalization

Normalization rewrites the raw name a provider puts on a stream into the name you want on a channel. Rules are authored in **Settings → Channel Normalization**, previewed with **Test Rules** before anything is saved, and can be applied retroactively to channels you already have. The articles below cover the concepts, a first-rule walkthrough, rule ordering, the full condition/action catalogue, the bulk apply flow, and what to do when the engine's output doesn't match what you expected. The deep technical reference already exists at [`docs/normalization.md`](https://github.com/MotWakorb/enhancedchannelmanager/blob/main/docs/normalization.md) (in the repository, not part of this published guide); this section is the operator-task wrapper around it, not a duplicate.

## Section purpose

Show operators how to author normalization rules in the **Settings → Channel Normalization** UI, how to use the **Test Rules** preview before saving, and how to run the **Apply to existing channels** one-time bulk rewrite when the rule set changes. Defer to the existing [`docs/normalization.md`](https://github.com/MotWakorb/enhancedchannelmanager/blob/main/docs/normalization.md) for the technical reference (parity contract, policy, SLO-5, regex sandboxing).

## Articles

| Article | Purpose |
|-|-|
| [How Normalization Works](concepts.md) | What normalization is and isn't, in operator language. The three places it runs (Test Rules, Auto Create, Apply to existing channels) and why they must agree. Quick pointer to the parity contract for operators who care. |
| [Author Your First Normalization Rule](author-your-first-rule.md) | Walk-through: open Settings → Normalization Rules, add a rule, preview it in Test Rules, save it. Includes the "iterate before saving" discipline. |
| [Rule Groups and Ordering](rule-groups-and-ordering.md) | Why groups exist, group priority vs. rule priority, the pipeline semantics (each rule sees the previous rule's output). |
| [Condition and Action Types](condition-and-action-types.md) | Tour of the available condition types (regex, prefix, contains, etc.) and action types (replace, strip, lowercase, etc.) with short examples. |
| [Apply Rules to Existing Channels](apply-to-existing-channels.md) | The one-time bulk rewrite flow: when to use it, what gets changed, undo/safety notes, expected duration on a large library. |
| [When Normalization Looks Wrong](when-things-look-wrong.md) | "Test Rules and Auto Create disagree": what that means, why it's a bug not a configuration issue, and the path to escalation (link to the canary-divergence runbook). |

## Going deeper

- [`docs/normalization.md`](https://github.com/MotWakorb/enhancedchannelmanager/blob/main/docs/normalization.md) (in the repository, not part of this published guide): the existing dual-audience reference. The first half is for operators (concepts, examples, parity contract); the developer reference at the bottom is for engineers integrating with the engine. The user guide articles above will summarise and link, not duplicate.
- [`docs/runbooks/normalization-canary-divergence.md`](https://github.com/MotWakorb/enhancedchannelmanager/blob/main/docs/runbooks/normalization-canary-divergence.md) (in the repository, not part of this published guide): what happens when the parity canary fires.
- [`docs/runbooks/normalization-unified-policy.md`](https://github.com/MotWakorb/enhancedchannelmanager/blob/main/docs/runbooks/normalization-unified-policy.md) (in the repository, not part of this published guide): operator implications of the unified policy.
