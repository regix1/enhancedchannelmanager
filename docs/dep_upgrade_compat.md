# Frontend Dependency Bump Cross-Compat Spike (bd-6rrl5.4)

- **Status**: Research complete; advisory to bd-6rrl5 epic
- **Date**: 2026-04-23
- **Bead**: `enhancedchannelmanager-6rrl5.4`
- **Scope**: Verify the recommended bump order in `bd-6rrl5` (TS6 → React 19 → Vite 8 + plugin-react 6 → ESLint 10 → jsdom 29 → @dnd-kit 10) interops at every step. Frontend-only; the backend half of `bd-6rrl5` (starlette 1.0 / fastapi 0.137 / uvicorn) is sequenced independently and is not in this spike's scope.
- **Companion**: ADR-001 (`docs/adr/ADR-001-dependency-upgrade-validation-gate.md`) defines the per-bump validation gate. This document defines the per-bump compat constraints upstream of that gate.

## TL;DR

| # | Bump | Verdict | Hard prerequisite | Notes |
|---|------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | jsdom 24 → 29 | **GO** (canary first per ADR-001) | None | Lowest blast radius; test-env only. Confirmed Node engines `^20.19.0 \|\| ^22.13.0 \|\| >=24` ✓ against `node:20-alpine` (20.20.2) in Dockerfile. |
| 2 | TypeScript 5.9.3 → 6.0.3 | **GO** | jsdom canary green | `typescript-eslint@8.58.2` (already pinned) peer-supports `>=4.8.4 <6.1.0`. TS 6.0.x fits, but **TS 6.1 will require a typescript-eslint bump**. ECM's tsconfig already matches every new TS 6.0 default that flipped (strict, ESNext, bundler, react-jsx). No code-level breaking changes expected. |
| 3 | React 19.2.x ecosystem | **GO with batched bumps** | TS 6.0 (peer alignment) | Must be a **single PR** that bumps `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, AND `@testing-library/react` 14 → **16.3.0+** together. Earlier 16.x (16.0.0–16.2.x) only declares `react ^18.0.0` peer; **16.3.0** widens to `^18.0.0 \|\| ^19.0.0`. Bumping 14→16.0 first then 16.0→16.3 buys nothing. Go straight to 16.3+. |
| 4 | Vite 7.3.2 → 8.x + plugin-react 5.1.4 → 6.x | **GO with caveat** | None hard, but order this AFTER React 19 to avoid double-debugging | `vitest@4.1.4` (current pin) peer-supports `vite ^6 \|\| ^7 \|\| ^8` ✓. `@vitejs/plugin-react@6` peer-requires `vite ^8.0.0`, so plugin-react bump is **strictly coupled** to the Vite bump (not separable). Note Vite 8 ships Rolldown by default. See Caveats below. |
| 5 | ESLint 9.39.2 → 10.x | **GO with one prerequisite bump bundled** | Must include `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` 7.0.1 → **7.1.0+** in the same PR | `7.0.1` peer is `^9.0.0` only and **fails** install against ESLint 10. Fix landed in `7.1.0` (peer expanded to include `^10.0.0`); `7.1.1` is the latest patch. `eslint-plugin-react-refresh@0.5.2` already peers `^9 \|\| ^10` ✓. `typescript-eslint@8.58.2` already peers `^10.0.0` ✓. |
| 6 | @dnd-kit/sortable 8 → 10 | **GO** | None | v10 peer is `@dnd-kit/core ^6.3.0`; current `@dnd-kit/core@6.3.1` already satisfies. No `@dnd-kit/core` major bump exists yet. v9→v10 changelog is dependency-update-only; the genuine breaking change (CollisionDetection signature returning `Collision[]`) landed in earlier majors (≤v6). ECM uses default `closestCenter`/`closestCorners` strategies (verified in `ChannelsPane.tsx`, `SubstitutionPairsEditor.tsx`, `ChannelListItem.tsx`). There is no custom collision detection, so the historical breaking change does not apply. |

**No required resequencing of the epic's child beads.** The epic's recommended order (`v28b8` → `in620` → `hlcgj` → `5x6n7` → `lx1gf` → `zqmv1`) is **almost** correct; one optimization detailed in §"Sequencing recommendations" below: run jsdom (`lx1gf`) FIRST as the canary per ADR-001 §"Open Questions, item 4". This contradicts the bd-6rrl5 epic order, but ADR-001 already overrides it.

**No blocking gotchas where two bumps must land in the same PR**, with one exception: **ESLint 10 + react-hooks plugin 7.1+** must batch (covered in #5 above; small enough not to violate the "one major per PR" grouping rule from ADR-001).

## Per-bump details with sources

### 1. jsdom 24.1.3 → 29.0.2 (`bd-lx1gf`)

**Verdict: GO. Run as the canary per ADR-001.**

- Engines: `^20.19.0 || ^22.13.0 || >=24.0.0` ([npm view jsdom@29.0.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom)). Dockerfile builder is `node:20-alpine` resolving to v20.20.2, which is within range ✓.
- Notable behavior changes that could touch ECM tests:
  - The CSSOM implementation was rebuilt in v29; `getComputedStyle()` results may shift. ECM tests rarely call `getComputedStyle` (none found in `src/**/*.test.tsx` for visual regression). Low risk, but watch for snapshot drift.
  - Promise/TypeError instances now created in the jsdom global, not Node global. Only matters if a test does `instanceof TypeError` against a value crossing the realm boundary. None observed.
  - `navigator.clipboard`, `matchMedia`, `ResizeObserver`, `IntersectionObserver`, `scrollTo` are mocked in `src/test/setup.ts`; jsdom's underlying behavior here is irrelevant because ECM overrides them.
  - `WebSocket` connection-per-origin throttling regressed in v28 (upstream undici bug). Not used in tests; no impact.
- **Source**: [jsdom releases](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/releases). The Changelog.md path on GitHub returns 404 for both `master` and `main`; releases page is the authoritative source.

### 2. TypeScript 5.9.3 → 6.0.3 (`bd-v28b8`)

**Verdict: GO.**

- ECM's current `tsconfig.json` is already aligned with every TS 6.0 default flip:

  | TS 6.0 default flip | ECM today | Status |
  |---|---|---|
  | `strict: true` (was false) | `strict: true` | ✓ no-op |
  | `module: esnext` (was commonjs) | `"module": "ESNext"` | ✓ no-op |
  | `target: es2025` (was es5) | `"target": "ES2020"` (explicit) | ✓ no flip (keeps ES2020) |
  | `moduleResolution: bundler` works | already `"bundler"` | ✓ no-op |
  | `jsx: react-jsx` works | already `"react-jsx"` | ✓ no-op |
  | `types` defaults to `[]` (was auto) | not set | ⚠️ minor (see below) |

- **`types` field implicit-to-explicit migration risk.** TS 6.0 stops auto-pulling all `node_modules/@types`. ECM does not declare `"types"` in `tsconfig.json` and does not appear to depend on ambient global types from any `@types/*` package other than `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` (both explicitly imported). Likely a no-op, but the engineer running `bd-v28b8` should run `tsc --noEmit` immediately after the bump and add `"types": ["..."]` only if a global-augment dependency surfaces.
- **Removed options that ECM does not use**: `module: amd|umd|systemjs|none`, `moduleResolution: classic`, `outFile`, `--rulesdir`, `--no-eslintrc`. None present in `tsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.node.json`. ✓
- **typescript-eslint compat**: `typescript-eslint@8.58.2` (current pin) declares `typescript: ">=4.8.4 <6.1.0"` peer ✓. TS 6.0.x fits; **TS 6.1 will require bumping typescript-eslint**. Track but not blocking.
- **Source**: [TypeScript 6.0 release notes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-6-0.html), [Announcing TypeScript 6.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-6-0/), `npm view typescript-eslint@8.58.2 peerDependencies`.

### 3. React 19.x ecosystem (`bd-in620`)

**Verdict: GO. PR must batch react + react-dom + @types/react + @types/react-dom + @testing-library/react 14 → 16.3.0+.**

- **The non-obvious peer-dep landmine.** `@testing-library/react@16.0.0–16.2.x` peer `react: ^18.0.0` only. `16.3.0` widens to `^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`. Skipping straight to 16.3.0+ is required; the bd-in620 description's `"@testing-library/react 16"` should be tightened to `"@testing-library/react ≥16.3.0"`.
- React 19 breaking changes that touch ECM patterns:

  | Removal | ECM exposure | Action |
  |---|---|---|
  | `ReactDOM.render` removed | `src/main.tsx` already uses `createRoot` (verified) | ✓ none |
  | `findDOMNode` removed | grep returns 0 hits in `frontend/src/` | ✓ none |
  | `defaultProps` on function components removed | grep returns 0 hits in non-test files | ✓ none |
  | `propTypes` silently ignored | not used (TypeScript) | ✓ none |
  | String refs removed | grep returns 0 hits | ✓ none |
  | Errors in render no longer re-thrown | ECM wraps in `ProtectedRoute` / `AuthProvider`; verify no test relies on uncaught throw bubbling | ⚠️ verify during in620 |
  | `act` import path moved (`react-dom/test-utils` → `react`) | grep returns 0 hits in `src/`; tests use `@testing-library/react` `act` re-export | ✓ none |
  | `forwardRef` still works (NOT removed) | dnd-kit internals use it; safe | ✓ none |
  | New JSX transform required | `tsconfig.json` already `"jsx": "react-jsx"` | ✓ none |

- React 19 codemods (`npx codemod@latest react/19/migration-recipe`) and `types-react-codemod@latest preset-19` are available; recommend running both in `bd-in620` even if grep is clean.

### 4. Vite 7.3.2 → 8.x + @vitejs/plugin-react 5.1.4 → 6.x (`bd-hlcgj`)

**Verdict: GO with three caveats.**

- **The bumps are strictly coupled.** `@vitejs/plugin-react@6.x` peer-requires `vite: ^8.0.0` ([npm view @vitejs/plugin-react@6.0.1 peerDependencies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitejs/plugin-react)). Cannot bump plugin-react without bumping Vite first; cannot keep plugin-react v5 with Vite 8 (Vite blog says "v5 still works with Vite 8", but that contradicts the published peer. Treat it as "may work, not officially supported" and do the joint bump as the bead describes).
- **Caveat 1: Rolldown is the new default bundler.** Vite 8 replaces esbuild+Rollup with the Rust-based Rolldown. Vite blog suggests gradual migration via the `rolldown-vite` package on Vite 7 first to isolate Rolldown-specific issues from other Vite 8 changes. **Recommended for ECM**: skip the rolldown-vite intermediate (low complexity build, no custom rollup plugins observed in `vite.config.ts`) but be ready to bisect if the build output regresses.
- **Caveat 2: config option renames.** `build.rollupOptions` → `build.rolldownOptions`, `worker.rollupOptions` → `worker.rolldownOptions`, `optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions` → `optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions`. ECM's `vite.config.ts` uses **none** of these (verified: the file is 23 lines, only `plugins`, `server.port/proxy/fs`, `build.outDir/emptyOutDir`). ✓ no-op for ECM.
- **Caveat 3: Babel removal in plugin-react v6.** v6 drops Babel as a direct dependency; React Refresh transform now runs through Oxc. ECM does not use custom Babel plugins (verified: no `.babelrc`, no Babel config in `vite.config.ts`). ✓ no action needed. If React Compiler were ever wanted, `reactCompilerPreset` + `@rolldown/plugin-babel` is the new path.
- **vitest peer compat**: `vitest@4.1.4` peer is `vite ^6.0.0 || ^7.0.0 || ^8.0.0` ✓. vitest is **already** Vite-8-ready and does not need to be bumped as part of this child.
- **Engines**: Vite 8 needs `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`. Dockerfile `node:20-alpine` (20.20.2) ✓.
- **Default browser target shifts** (Chrome 107→111, Firefox 104→114, Safari 16.0→16.4). ECM has no documented browser-support floor; risk is low.
- **Source**: [Vite 8 announcement](https://vite.dev/blog/announcing-vite8), [Vite migration guide](https://vite.dev/guide/migration), [@vitejs/plugin-react CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/CHANGELOG.md), `npm view vite@8.0.1 engines peerDependencies`, `npm view @vitejs/plugin-react@6.0.1 peerDependencies`, `npm view vitest@4.1.4 peerDependencies`.

### 5. ESLint 9.39.2 → 10.x (`bd-5x6n7`)

**Verdict: GO. PR must batch `eslint` + `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` 7.0.1 → 7.1.0+ (or 7.1.1).**

- **The blocking peer-dep gotcha.** `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@7.0.1` (currently pinned) declares peer `eslint: ^3.0.0 || ^4.0.0 || ... || ^9.0.0`. It does not include `^10.0.0`. Installing ESLint 10 against this combination produces an unmet peer dep, which `npm install` may surface as a warning and which `npm audit` / strict installers treat as an error. The fix landed in `react-hooks@7.1.0` (peer expanded to include `^10.0.0`); latest is `7.1.1`. Both 7.1.0 and 7.1.1 are published to npm and verified via `npm view eslint-plugin-react-hooks@7.1.1 peerDependencies`.
- **Other plugin compat (already satisfied):**
  - `typescript-eslint@8.58.2` peer: `eslint: ^8.57.0 || ^9.0.0 || ^10.0.0` ✓
  - `eslint-plugin-react-refresh@0.5.2` peer: `eslint: ^9 || ^10` ✓
  - `@eslint/js@10` is the matching `eslint:recommended` source ✓
  - `globals@17.5.0` is current and unchanged across the bump ✓
- **Flat config already in use.** ECM's `eslint.config.mjs` uses `defineConfig([...])` flat-config form. ESLint 10 removes legacy `.eslintrc` entirely. ECM is unaffected.
- **Behavior change**: ESLint 10 locates `eslint.config.*` from each linted file's directory rather than CWD. ECM has only one config at `frontend/eslint.config.mjs` and lints from `frontend/`, so single-config monorepos are unaffected. ✓
- **`eslint:recommended` rule additions in v10** may flag new issues; the engineer running `bd-5x6n7` should expect to fix or `eslint-disable`-with-comment some new findings on first run.
- **Engines**: `^20.19.0 || ^22.13.0 || >=24` ✓.
- **Source**: [ESLint v10 migration guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-10.0.0), [ESLint v10 release blog](https://eslint.org/blog/2026/02/eslint-v10.0.0-released/), [eslint-plugin-react-hooks ESLint 10 PR #35720](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35720), [eslint-plugin-react-hooks ESLint 10 issue #35758](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/35758), `npm view eslint-plugin-react-hooks@7.1.1 peerDependencies`.

### 6. @dnd-kit/sortable 8.0.0 → 10.0.0 (`bd-zqmv1`)

**Verdict: GO.**

- v10 peer: `@dnd-kit/core ^6.3.0`; current `@dnd-kit/core@6.3.1` ✓. **No joint bump of `@dnd-kit/core` is needed**, contradicting the bd-zqmv1 description's "may need joint bump" hedge.
- v9→v10 changelog is **only a dependency bump to `@dnd-kit/core@6.3.0`**, with no API changes.
- v8→v9 changelog is **only a `id === 0` bug fix**, with no API changes.
- The `CollisionDetection` interface refactor (return `Collision[]` instead of `UniqueIdentifier`, take `{active, collisionRect, droppableContainers}`) that the search results highlighted **landed in earlier majors (≤v6)**; ECM is already on v8 so this breaking change is already absorbed.
- ECM's dnd-kit usage (`ChannelsPane.tsx`, `SubstitutionPairsEditor.tsx`, `ChannelListItem.tsx`) uses default collision strategies, with no custom `CollisionDetection` functions to update.

## Sequencing recommendations

The bd-6rrl5 epic description proposes:
> **TS6 → React 19 → vite 8 + plugin-react 6 → eslint 10 → jsdom 29 → @dnd-kit 10**

ADR-001 §"Open Questions, item 4" already overrides this:
> **Resolved: bd-lx1gf (jsdom 24→29) is the canary. Test-env-only scope, minimal runtime blast radius.**

This spike confirms the ADR-001 override is correct: jsdom is the safest first move because failures are confined to the test runner, and `bd-lx1gf` exercises the new ADR-001 fresh-build CI gate end-to-end before higher-stakes bumps run through it.

**Recommended sequence for the frontend half of bd-6rrl5:**

| # | Bead | Bump | Rationale |
|---|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | `bd-lx1gf` | jsdom 24 → 29 | Canary per ADR-001. Test-env only. Validates the new CI gate. |
| 2 | `bd-v28b8` | TypeScript 5.9 → 6.0 | Foundation: every later bump's `.d.ts` will be type-checked under TS 6. Aligned tsconfig means low compile-error blast. |
| 3 | `bd-in620` | React 19 ecosystem (single PR: react + react-dom + @types/react + @types/react-dom + **@testing-library/react ≥16.3.0**) | After TS 6 so `@types/react@19` resolves cleanly under the new compiler. |
| 4 | `bd-hlcgj` | Vite 7→8 + plugin-react 5→6 (single PR; strictly coupled) | Tooling bump. After React 19 so any RSC-style import-map gotchas show up against an already-bumped React. |
| 5 | `bd-5x6n7` | ESLint 9→10 (single PR: eslint + **eslint-plugin-react-hooks 7.0.1→7.1.1**) | Independent of runtime; can technically run earlier, but its `eslint:recommended` v10 churn is best deferred until codebase has settled into React 19 + Vite 8 idioms. |
| 6 | `bd-zqmv1` | @dnd-kit/sortable 8 → 10 | Last because manual smoke for drag-reorder UX is the slowest gate. |

The `bd-6rrl5.3` baseline (`docs/dep_upgrade_baseline.md`) must land before #2; it's already an explicit dependency on `bd-v28b8`, `bd-6rrl5.1`, `bd-6rrl5.2`. ✓

The bd-zqmv1 → bd-lx1gf dependency edge in beads is currently inverted vs. this recommended order. Either accept that edge as-is (lx1gf runs first, satisfying it) or remove it during the next grooming pass. Either way, there is no functional issue.

## Cadence implication for ADR-001

**No throttle.** ADR-001's per-week cadence rule was removed on 2026-04-25 (see ADR-001 Revision History). The one-major-bump-per-PR grouping rule still applies, but there is no wall-clock spacing requirement between merged dep-bump PRs. Merges are bounded only by branch-protection serialization and CI gate latency.

## Required acceptance-criteria additions for child beads

Per this spike, the following should be added to the corresponding child bead descriptions before they enter "ready":

- **bd-in620** (React 19): tighten `"@testing-library/react 16"` to `"@testing-library/react ≥16.3.0"`. Also add: "PR must batch react, react-dom, @types/react, @types/react-dom, @testing-library/react in a single commit set; any one alone leaves an unsatisfied React 19 peer-dep graph."
- **bd-5x6n7** (ESLint 10): add: "PR must include `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` bump from 7.0.1 to 7.1.1 (or current 7.1.x). 7.0.1's peer-dep range stops at ESLint 9 and will block the install."
- **bd-zqmv1** (@dnd-kit/sortable 10): correct/remove "may need joint bump with @dnd-kit/core". v10 peer-requires `@dnd-kit/core ^6.3.0` and current `@dnd-kit/core@6.3.1` already satisfies this. No `@dnd-kit/core@7+` exists.
- **bd-v28b8** (TypeScript 6): add forward-watch note: `typescript-eslint@8.58.2` peer caps at `<6.1.0`. **TS 6.1 release will require a typescript-eslint major/minor bump** before that TS bump can land. This is out of scope for v28b8 but should be noted.

These are advisory-only edits (description tightening); none invalidates the existing per-bead validation gate from ADR-001.
