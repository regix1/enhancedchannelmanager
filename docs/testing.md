# Testing Guidelines

This fork runs only the Docker image workflow in `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
Run the quality checks below locally. Sections describing required checks,
workflow classifiers and CI coverage policy document the upstream project;
those test and security workflows are not installed in this fork.

## Test Infrastructure Overview

This project has comprehensive test coverage at three levels.

> **DBAS round-trip test environment** (ECM ↔ live Dispatcharr): a pinned,
> throwaway Dispatcharr stack + production-shaped seed tooling lives in
> [`tests/dbas-test-env/`](../tests/dbas-test-env/). Strategy and rationale:
> [`docs/testing/dbas-test-env.md`](testing/dbas-test-env.md). Use it to validate
> the round-trip success signal against a real Dispatcharr instead of the
> assumption-encoding mocks in `backend/tests/fixtures/mock_dispatcharr.py`.

## 1. Backend Tests (Python/pytest)

> **Always run backend tests under the project venv**, not a bare system
> `python3`: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` (or the path-relative equivalent
> from wherever you're running, since the point is the interpreter, not the cwd).
> The project pins `cryptography` at 42+; a bare system `python3` commonly
> resolves an older `cryptography` (e.g. 41.0.7) that is missing
> `x509.Certificate.not_valid_before_utc` / `not_valid_after_utc` (added in
> cryptography 42). That gap produces 7-9 confusing failures in
> `backend/tests/unit/test_tls_storage.py`: assertion failures on subject/
> validity fields, not an obvious `AttributeError`, because the code under
> test catches the exception broadly. Two engineers independently lost time
> to this (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-vol5d`) before the affected tests
> were given a version-gated skip that names the fix in its reason string.
> If you see that skip fire, you're not on the venv interpreter.

> **Writing a security test that needs a credential-shaped fixture** (a token,
> password, or webhook URL)? See "Credential Fixtures in Security Tests" in
> [`docs/pytest_conventions.md`](pytest_conventions.md) before you write the
> literal. The convention there is now a convention only: the secrets ratchet
> (`scripts/check_secrets.py`) that used to enforce it was removed with the CI
> gate reduction, so nothing fails the build if you ignore it.

## What the backend gate runs

**One invocation: `scripts/backend-gate.sh`.** It takes no arguments, selects the project interpreter itself, and runs exactly what `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs. `backend/tests/unit/test_backend_gate_contract.py` asserts the two still match flag for flag, so they cannot drift apart.

```bash
scripts/backend-gate.sh    # THE gate. Check $? — do not pipe to `tail` and read that.
```

Two invocations used to circulate — one from `backend/CLAUDE.md` prose, one from CI — differing by **72 collected tests** (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-c9lb9`). Nothing was failing, so it was an instrument gap rather than a live defect, but it is the false-green class: "backend gate green" could be reported by a run that never executed those 72, and the figure looked authoritative because every handover repeated it.

### What the backend gate excludes, and why

Every exclusion is named. A bare "2 deselected" is an unreadable signal.

| Excluded | How | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/e2e/` (10 files) | `--ignore` | Hits a live ECM container on `localhost:6100`. Without one it self-skips; with one it exercises whatever that container happens to be running — a result that depends on unrelated local state cannot gate a PR. E2E as a CI gate is deferred to bead `enhancedchannelmanager-2lw25`. |
| `tests/performance/` (2 files) | `--ignore` | Seeds a 250k-row fixture; runs in the dedicated `perf-benchmarks` workflow (`bd-skqln.10`). |
| `test_find_candidate_under_5ms_per_call_for_500_candidates` | `-m "not slow"` | Wall-clock microbenchmark with a 5 ms soft cap. Host contention on a runner false-fails it, and the latency figure is informational, not a gate. Still runs under an explicit `-m slow`. |
| `test_migration_up_down_against_5m_rows` | `-m "not slow"` | Times an Alembic up/down against ~5M `session_telemetry` rows. Local pre-merge only (`bd-skqln.2`); also guarded by `ECM_RUN_VOLUME_TESTS`, so it self-skips even when selected. |

Expected shape on a green `dev`: **`3 skipped, 2 deselected`**. A full-tree run (`pytest tests/`, no ignores) reports **9 skipped** instead — the other 6 live in the excluded trees. **`18 skipped` from either means the wrong interpreter** (see below).

### The interpreter is part of the gate

Ambient `python` commonly resolves an older `cryptography` build and **silently self-skips 9 TLS tests** instead of failing, so the run still reports success. The gap is invisible unless you compare skip counts. `scripts/backend-gate.sh` resolves the interpreter itself — `$ECM_PYTHON`, else the repo `.venv`, else (in a git worktree, which has no `.venv` of its own) the main checkout's, derived from `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` — and **refuses to run rather than fall back** to ambient `python`.

### The subset-run coverage trap

`pytest.ini` sets `--cov=. --cov-fail-under=56`, and coverage is measured over the **whole tree** regardless of what you selected. So *any* subset run exits non-zero even when every test in it passes — a bare `--collect-only` reports `Required test coverage of 56% not reached. Total coverage: 18.39%`. Read as a real failure, that has sent agents off to "fix" a healthy tree.

```bash
scripts/backend-gate.sh --subset tests/unit/test_foo.py -k some_case
```

`--subset` adds `--no-cov` and prints a banner. **A `--subset` run is not the gate** and must never be reported as one.

## Backend Test Layers: `integration/` vs `routers/`

These two directories are distinct testing layers. They are not duplicates of each other.

### `backend/tests/integration/`: Shallow, mock-DB layer

Files named `test_api_<domain>.py` and other integration-scoped tests.

- **Client**: `fastapi.testclient.TestClient` (synchronous)
- **Database**: `MagicMock()` session injected via `patch("routers.<module>.get_session")`
- **Depth**: Shallow, asserting API shapes, status codes, and routing without touching real SQL
- **When to add tests here**: Verifying API contracts that can be fully expressed by mocking the DB query results; testing how the router reacts to DB-layer exceptions; lightweight smoke checks that don't require real ORM behaviour

### `backend/tests/routers/`: Deep, real-DB layer

Files named `test_<domain>.py`.

- **Client**: `httpx.AsyncClient` via the `async_client` fixture in `conftest.py` (async)
- **Database**: Real in-memory SQLite (`StaticPool`) via the `test_session` fixture: full ORM round-trips
- **Depth**: Deep, inserting real rows, exercising ORM queries, validating constraints and model
  relationships
- **When to add tests here**: Verifying that endpoints interact correctly with actual database state;
  testing model constraints, ordering, pagination, and FK relationships; any scenario where a
  MagicMock DB session would hide a real ORM bug

### Naming inversion note

Despite the directory names, the `integration/` layer is the **shallower, more-mocked** layer and the `routers/` layer is the **deeper, less-mocked** layer.  This naming reflects historical test organisation rather than the standard "integration = real dependencies" convention.  New tests added here should follow the existing pattern in each directory rather than trying to reclassify tests based on name alone.

### Acceptable duplication

A handful of trivially simple cases (`GET /some/endpoint → 404 Not Found`) are
intentionally present in both layers.  This is acceptable because each copy exercises
different machinery (sync+mock-DB vs async+real-DB) and provides independent signal.
Do not consolidate these just to reduce line count.

**Running E2E Tests:**
```bash
npm run test:e2e           # Headless mode (CI/CD)
npm run test:e2e:ui        # Interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:headed    # Run in visible browser
npm run test:e2e:debug     # Debug mode with breakpoints
npm run test:e2e:report    # View test report
```

> **`E2E_BASE_URL` is required. There is no default.** It used to default to
> `http://localhost:6100`, the product owner's LIVE ECM instance holding real
> channel data, so an unset variable silently pointed write-capable specs (a
> channel-number push-down, a cross-group move, a merge, a delete) at
> production (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-536bl`). Config load in
> `playwright-base-url.mjs` now throws before any browser launches or any
> request is made if `E2E_BASE_URL` is unset and `E2E_EXACT_BUILD` is not
> `true`. Set it explicitly:
> ```bash
> E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:6100 npm run test:e2e   # explicit opt-in to the live instance
> E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 npm run test:e2e   # against a dev server you started yourself
> ```
> Or skip it entirely with `E2E_START_SERVER=true E2E_EXACT_BUILD=true`, which
> builds and serves the checked-out source on its own isolated preview port
> (`127.0.0.1:4173`) and supplies that base URL itself. This is the mode the
> `Screen-Reader-Only Rendering Guard`, `Operator Workspace Release Matrix`,
> `Edit Mode Immediacy Surfaces Guard`, `Edit Mode Numbering Guards` and `Edit
> Mode Session Restore Guard` CI jobs used before those jobs were removed; it
> is now how you run these specs by hand, and it sets no `E2E_BASE_URL`.

### Rendered-CSS regression guards

Ten specs in `e2e/` are not feature tests. They are guards over what a real
browser *renders*, the layer where the project has repeatedly regressed while
every unit test stayed green. They exist because a computed style, or a real
seam crossed in a real page, is the only thing that can prove these claims;
jsdom cannot, and neither can a declaration-level audit.

The first seven rows below are pure rendered-CSS guards. The last three arrived
with the Edit Mode staging and numbering epic and are wider than CSS: one
measures layout, and two cross a UI-to-network seam that no unit suite reaches.
They are tabled here because they share the property that makes this section
worth having, which is that every layer beneath them can be green while the
thing itself is broken.

| Spec | What it pins | Proven red against |
|-|-|-|
| `sr-only-hidden.spec.ts` | `.sr-only` / `.visually-hidden` measure ≤1×1 and are not returned by `elementFromPoint`, **on a cold context with Channel Pipeline never visited** | `.sr-only` moved back into the ChannelPipelineTab chunk (bead `-zncyv`): Dashboard 1004×24, `position: static`, hit-testable |
| `frozen-chrome.spec.ts` | rail 244px, rail label 14px/400, rail icon 20px, header band 45px, route title 20px/700/26px, all measured across ten routes × dark/light/high-contrast × 1600×1000, 1280×800 and 1280×720 | a bare `.primary-sidebar` / `.navigation-label` redeclaration inside `LogoManagerTab.css`: every route visited *after* Logo Manager reported 248px / 15px |
| `route-typography-scale.spec.ts` | every visible text node in a route content pane computes to a P1 size: {20, 15, 13, 11, 10} text, {18, 16, 14, 64} icon | a new 22px site on M3U Manager **and** an allowlisted site silently fixed without deleting its entry (reported as `STALE`) |
| `cross-route-css-leak.spec.ts` | shared-class typography does not depend on route visit order | four historical instances: `.list-header`, `.status-label`, `.group-count`, `.action-btn .material-icons` |
| `contrast-aa.spec.ts` | every visible text node on all eleven routes clears WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large and non-text glyphs) in dark/light/high-contrast at 1280×720 and 1920×1080, measured as **true composited** contrast (whole ancestor background chain, element and ancestor `opacity`, colours resolved through the compositor rather than parsed) | the three light-theme `--accent-secondary` selected states of bead `-dlavh`: Stats pill 3.68, Settings pill 3.68, Settings rail row 3.25, all against 4.5. It also found two defects nobody had reported: the selected primary-rail row at 4.20 on **every** route, and the Channel Manager probe glyph failing in all three themes |
| `settings-nav-groups.spec.ts` | the Settings drill-in renders the approved six groups in order with `aria-current` and real `#settings/<page>` anchors, and the rail's overflow **contract** holds (it scrolls, Back stays pinned and opaque, the last destination stays reachable) at 1280×720 and 1920×1080 × three themes, expanded and collapsed | the grouped rail at 1099px against a 675px budget at 1280×720 with Back `position: static`: the only exit from Settings scrolled out of view (bead `-70u0r.4`) |
| `control-typeface.spec.ts` | every visible `button`/`input`/`select`/`textarea` on ten routes renders in the SAME resolved face as its nearest text-bearing ancestor (arm 1), and at a size the application chose rather than the user-agent's own control default (arm 2) | arm 1 (bead `-6z299.9`): controls resolving to generic `sans-serif` while surrounding text resolved to `system-ui`, invisible to a `fontFamily` string comparison. Arm 2 (bead `-ul2tp`): 274 of 418 visible controls across the ten routes rendering at Chromium's 13.3333px UA default with arm 1 green throughout |
| `edit-mode-immediacy-surfaces.spec.ts` | three layouts the staged-vs-immediate work introduced: the selection bar still floats from `.selection-action-bar-shell` rather than landing in document flow; the irreversible-action notice claims its own line in `.modal-footer` through the one `:has()` rule that behaviour depends on; and the immediate-action note fits the two dropdown menus and the modal toolbar it is injected into (beads `-kz089`, `-i4yk1`) | jsdom cannot see any of the three. `SelectionActionBar` renders identical DOM whether or not `position: fixed` survived the move onto the shell wrapper, so every component test stays green while the bar drops off the bottom of a scrolled list |
| `edit-mode-numbering-guards.spec.ts` | a real double-click in a real channel list, a real duplicate-number dialog, a real acknowledgement reaching the staged ledger, and an Apply over a colliding final state that issues **no** bulk-commit request at all (beads `-vdxbx`, `-ic884.2`) | the seam, not the layers: `channelNumberPlan.test.ts`, `ChannelsPane.duplicateNumber.test.tsx` and `useEditMode.numberingPreflight.test.ts` are each green on their own side of it. Arm 2 carries its own anti-vacuity control, applying a clean plan first and watching that request go, because "sent no request" is equally satisfied by a dead button or a page that never loaded |
| `edit-mode-session-restore.spec.ts` | a ledger in real `sessionStorage` surviving a real page load, read on the first render of the real `App` inside `ProtectedRoute` and offered back with an account of what no longer applies (arm 1); a ledger stamped with a **different** operator never offered and already gone from the store by first paint (arm 2) (epic `-r93hq`, bead `-jazna`) | arm 2 is the one that matters: two operators sharing a workstation, where handing A's staged edits to B means B applies them under B's credentials and the journal attributes every change to B |

`frozen-chrome.spec.ts` pins **1280×720 as well as 1280×800** because 1280×720
is the minimum supported viewport, and the height is what the Settings drill-in
strains. Both rows are kept; dropping one from a frozen matrix is not free.

```bash
npm run test:css-guard:sr-only            # builds + serves the source; NO backend needed
npm run test:css-guard:frozen-chrome      # needs a live ECM backend
npm run test:css-guard:type-scale         # needs a live ECM backend
npm run test:css-guard:contrast-aa        # needs a live ECM backend; ~10 min, 66 route walks
npm run test:css-leak                     # needs a live ECM backend
npm run test:css-guards                   # all of the above, against a live backend
npm run test:css-guard:settings-nav       # needs a live ECM backend
npm run test:css-guard:control-typeface   # needs a live ECM backend
npm run test:css-guard:edit-mode-immediacy        # builds + serves the source; NO backend
npm run test:css-guard:edit-mode-numbering        # builds + serves the source; NO backend
npm run test:css-guard:edit-mode-session-restore  # builds + serves the source; NO backend
```

The three Edit Mode guards do not merely *tolerate* the absence of a backend,
they **refuse** to run with one. Each requires `E2E_EXACT_BUILD=true` and
`E2E_START_SERVER=true`, which build the checked-out source and serve it on the
isolated preview port `127.0.0.1:4173` and supply the base URL themselves, so
none of them can be aimed at an operator's live ECM. That refusal is structural
rather than advisory because of what they exercise: a merge and a CSV import
that delete and create channels, and an Apply path that commits.

Two further browser guards, `control-box-size.spec.ts` and
`filter-select-ownership.spec.ts`, have `npm` scripts (`test:css-guard:control-box-size`,
`test:css-guard:filter-select`) but no row in the table above. That gap predates
this section's last revision and is recorded here rather than left invisible.

**CI status: read this before assuming coverage. Every browser guard below
is now manual-only.**

The CI gate reduction removed every Playwright job from
`.github/workflows/test.yml` (`Visual Regression`, `Operator Workspace Release
Matrix`, `Screen-Reader-Only Rendering Guard`, `Edit Mode Immediacy Surfaces
Guard`, `Edit Mode Numbering Guards`, `Edit Mode Session Restore Guard`) and
the two Playwright steps that had been bolted onto the `Frontend Tests` job.
No surviving workflow installs a browser or invokes `playwright`.

- `sr-only-hidden.spec.ts`, `edit-mode-immediacy-surfaces.spec.ts`,
  `edit-mode-numbering-guards.spec.ts` and `edit-mode-session-restore.spec.ts`
  **used to run in CI** and no longer do. The specs, their `npm` scripts and
  `e2e/fixtures/css-guard.ts` are all unchanged, so they still run by hand
  with `E2E_START_SERVER=true E2E_EXACT_BUILD=true`, which builds the
  checked-out source and serves it on an isolated preview port with no
  backend. Nothing runs them for you, and nothing reports when they go red.
- `e2e/visual/modal-typography-inventory.spec.ts` and
  `e2e/visual/heatmap.spec.ts` are likewise manual-only, via
  `npm run test:visual` (`playwright.visual.config.ts`). There is no `npm`
  script for the modal-typography inventory on its own; invoke it through the
  config directly.
- `frozen-chrome.spec.ts`, `route-typography-scale.spec.ts`,
  `contrast-aa.spec.ts`, `cross-route-css-leak.spec.ts` and
  `control-typeface.spec.ts` are **manual-only**.
  This is not an oversight and not a "wire it up later": all five walk every route, and
  Channel Manager's `.channels-pane` never mounts without an API (measured, on
  a backend-less preview build: `waitForSelector('.channels-pane')` times out
  at 60s). They need a live ECM container, which CI does not have; that is the
  same constraint that defers the rest of `e2e/*.spec.ts`, tracked as bead
  `enhancedchannelmanager-2lw25`. When 2lw25 lands a live-service CI
  environment these five are the first specs that should move into it.
- Until then the browser half of the CSS defence runs only when a human
  remembers. Run `npm run test:css-guards` against the running container
  before shipping any change under `frontend/src/**/*.css`.

**These guards measure the build that is being SERVED, not your working tree.**
Point them at the deployed container on `:6100` explicitly. `E2E_BASE_URL`
has no default (see above), so it must be set, and running them against a
container that has not been redeployed since your edit reports the *old*
build's CSS, and the type-scale guard will list the sites you just fixed as
brand-new failures. Observed exactly that: nine sites fixed in the tree still
showed as off-scale on `:6100` because the container predated the fix.

```bash
# sr-only: builds and serves YOUR tree, no container involved. Always exact,
# and E2E_START_SERVER + E2E_EXACT_BUILD already supply their own base URL.
npm run test:css-guard:sr-only

# the others: deploy your build to the container FIRST, then run against it explicitly.
scripts/deploy-frontend.sh
E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:6100 npm run test:css-guards
```

**Or serve your own tree and skip the deploy entirely.** `vite preview`
inherits `server.proxy` from `frontend/vite.config.ts`, so it *does* proxy
`/api` to `http://localhost:8000`. With a backend answering there, the whole
guard set runs against the working tree with nothing deployed:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build && npx vite preview --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173 &
E2E_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 npm run test:css-guards
```

Measured on bead `-70u0r.4`: `sr-only-hidden`, `frozen-chrome`,
`route-typography-scale`, `cross-route-css-leak` and `settings-nav-groups` all
green this way, including `frozen-chrome`'s full ten-route walk with Channel
Manager's `.channels-pane` mounting normally, so a backend-less preview is not
the constraint the paragraph above assumed. `control-typeface` was verified the
same way under bead `-ae3ms`, the pass that wired it into `test:css-guards`:
all 21 tests across the full seven-spec aggregate passed against a `vite
preview` tree with `/api` proxied to the live container. This corrects an earlier claim that preview "proxies
nothing, so `/api` 502s". That was true of a bare static server, not of
`vite preview`. Use it whenever you must measure rendered CSS *before*
committing or deploying; it is the only way to run these guards against an
uncommitted tree. The caveat that survives is the important one: **these
guards measure the build being SERVED.** Rebuild after every edit, or you are
re-measuring the previous bundle.

**Their allowlist cannot rot.** `route-typography-scale.spec.ts` carries an
allowlist because eight of ten routes have off-scale sites today, and it is
bidirectional on purpose, following the same discipline as TIER 2 of
`frontend/src/cssAudits/sharedClassChunkLeak.audit.test.ts`. A **new**
off-scale site fails; a **stale** entry (its site now renders on-scale) also
fails, with "delete this entry"; an entry whose selector matches nothing fails
unless it is marked `dataDependent`. Fixing an allowlisted site therefore
*requires* deleting its entry in the same commit. Every entry names the bead
that owns it.

**Shared plumbing lives in `e2e/fixtures/css-guard.ts`,** and three things in
it are load-bearing rather than convenience:

1. **One login per spec file.** `backend/auth/routes.py` rate-limits login at
   `5/minute`; these guards open many contexts and a login per context blows
   that budget, surfacing as `Login failed: Too Many Requests`, a flake that
   reads like a broken assertion.
2. **Hash navigation, never `page.reload()`.** Every route tab is a lazy chunk
   whose stylesheet is appended to `<head>` on first visit and never removed.
   A reload discards all of them, resetting the exact state these guards
   observe and silently turning a real failure into a pass.
3. **An explicit `waitFor` on the login gate.** `isVisible({ timeout })` is a
   no-op in Playwright (the option is ignored), so a still-rendering login
   form reads as "not a login page" and the run proceeds into a blank shell.

## 4. Modal harness (dev-only dialog measurement)

`frontend/modal-harness.html` force-renders **every dialog in the app** with
stubbed data, including the many that cannot be reached against a real
instance (no pending merges, empty review queues, no probe results, banner
conditions unmet). It exists so a CSS change touching modals can be verified
against all of them instead of the subset today's data happens to allow.
Introduced by bead `enhancedchannelmanager-xhldy.1` for the P1 type-scale
work; reusable for any later restyle of the same surfaces.

```bash
# Capture / re-capture the baseline (builds the harness, walks all dialogs)
node scripts/measure-modal-typography.mjs

# After a CSS change: what moved?
node scripts/measure-modal-typography.mjs --diff

# Poke at one dialog by hand
cd frontend && npx vite --config vite.harness.config.ts
# -> http://127.0.0.1:5273/modal-harness.html            (index of all dialogs)
# -> http://127.0.0.1:5273/modal-harness.html?dialog=edit-channel
# -> ...&theme=light   ...&live=1 (talk to a real backend instead of the stub)
```

Baseline artefact:
`frontend/src/devHarness/baseline/modal-typography.baseline.json`.

**Every capture is animation-frozen, and captures made before that was true
have untrustworthy GEOMETRY.** `ModalBase.css` opens each dialog with
`modal-container-slide-in` (0.2s, `scale(0.98)` to `scale(1)`), and a capture
taken mid-flight multiplies every box in the dialog by a run-dependent scale
factor. Measured on bead `enhancedchannelmanager-iotbh`: one unfrozen run
reported the 32px close button at seven different sizes across the 81 dialogs,
and a change that could only shrink type by 0.33px moved 214 of 281 boxes by 1
to 11px. The script now suppresses animations and transitions before it
measures, with no flag to turn that off, and stamps `animationsFrozen: true`
into the payload. A capture without that field predates the fix. Two
consecutive frozen runs over an unchanged tree now move 0 of 411 geometry rows.
Typography rows were never affected, since `font-size` and `font-weight` are
not scaled by a transform.

**It is not in the production bundle, and cannot be.** `vite.config.ts` has a
single entry (`index.html`); the harness is built only by the separate
`vite.harness.config.ts` into the gitignored `.modal-harness-dist/`.
`src/devHarness/harnessIsolation.test.ts` fails if any app file imports harness
code or if `vite.config.ts` grows a second entry.

**The dialog list is derived from source, not hand-maintained.** Every
non-test `.tsx` under `src/` is scanned for `modal-container` / `ModalOverlay`
/ `role="dialog"` / `role="alertdialog"`, and
`src/devHarness/harnessCoverage.test.ts` goes RED when a file matching those
markers has no entry in `dialogCatalog.ts`. A dialog added later is therefore
covered automatically, or it breaks the build. It cannot be silently missed.

Adding a dialog to the harness:

1. Add an entry to `src/devHarness/dialogCatalog.ts` (`status: 'stubbed'`, or
   `'gap'` with a reason if it genuinely cannot be force-rendered).
2. Add a recipe to `src/devHarness/dialogRenderers.tsx`. `tsc --noEmit` fails
   until you do. Either render the component directly with stub props, or
   render its host and list the `open` clicks that bring the dialog up.
3. Add stub responses to `src/devHarness/apiStub.ts` if it fetches on mount.

Never change a component to suit the harness. If a dialog cannot be reached
without editing it, record it as a gap.

## Coverage ratchet cadence

Coverage is enforced in CI as a **one-way ratchet**: the current floor is the
baseline measured 2026-04-20 during bead `enhancedchannelmanager-nmlxi`, minus
a small regression buffer. Crossing below those numbers fails the CI job.

### Current thresholds

| Suite | Metric | Measured 2026-04-20 | Threshold | Buffer | Where enforced |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Backend (pytest + coverage.py) | lines | 58% | 56% | 2 pts | `backend/pytest.ini` (`--cov-fail-under=56`), paths in `backend/.coveragerc` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | statements | 15.17% | 13% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.statements` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | branches | 14.13% | 12% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.branches` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | functions | 15.28% | 13% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.functions` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | lines | 15.46% | 13% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.lines` |

Backend measurement: `docker exec ecm-ecm-1 sh -c 'cd /app && python -m pytest
--ignore=tests/e2e -m "not slow" --cov-config=/tmp/.coveragerc --cov=.
--cov-report=term'` with the three known-drift deselects from the flake
section above. 2427 tests, 3 deselected.

Frontend measurement: `cd frontend && npm run test:coverage`. 1118 tests across
44 files.

### Rationale for buffer choice

The ideal methodology (from bead `enhancedchannelmanager-nmlxi`) is to wait
~1 week after the CI test-gate landed (`enhancedchannelmanager-t8xw3`) so we
can observe real per-PR coverage numbers rather than the full-suite snapshot.
We didn't have that window. t8xw3 closed the day this bead landed. The PO
approved a single full-suite snapshot with a 2-point buffer as a pragmatic
baseline. Expect slightly churny CI on PRs that touch low-coverage modules
until the first re-ratchet.

### Re-ratchet policy

- **Cadence**: review the thresholds **2-4 weeks after this bead lands**,
  once real PR coverage data exists. Thereafter, review quarterly (aligned
  with the flake sweep).
- **Raise criterion**: if every PR merged in the review window held coverage
  comfortably (≥ threshold + 3 points) on every metric, raise that metric's
  threshold by **~5 points**. Never raise by more than 5 points in one
  review. This gives authors time to respond before the ratchet tightens further.
- **Lower prohibition**: thresholds are **one-way**. Lowering requires
  explicit PO approval and a one-line rationale in the commit message. Do
  not lower "because my PR didn't quite make it". Add tests instead.
- **Per-metric independence**: frontend has four metrics (lines, branches,
  functions, statements). They ratchet independently. A PR that lifts
  function coverage to 20% should raise the function threshold to 15%.
  It does not have to wait for statements to also move.
- **Scope creep guard**: this bead's predecessor (`t8xw3`) explicitly
  excludes retroactively force-testing low-coverage modules. The ratchet
  exists to prevent regression, not to force a coverage sprint.

### Next-iteration upgrade: diff-coverage

The bead scope flagged **diff-coverage** (coverage of CHANGED lines only)
as a likely better gate for a 61K-line codebase: whole-codebase coverage
is noisy for small PRs. This is out of scope for the current ratchet bead
and should be filed as a follow-up. Candidate tools:

- Python: `diff-cover` (PyPI) integrates cleanly with coverage.xml.
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `diff-cover` also consumes v8/lcov output.

When we file the follow-up, the gate becomes "changed lines must hit X%
coverage" with X set conservatively (≥ 80% seems reasonable given the base
rates above) and the whole-codebase thresholds stay as a floor.

### Running coverage locally

```bash
# Backend — from the host. This IS the CI invocation; coverage is auto-enabled
# via pytest.ini addopts, so the ratchet is enforced by the same run.
scripts/backend-gate.sh

# Frontend — from the host.
cd frontend && npm run test:coverage
```

For a quick single-file run, use `scripts/backend-gate.sh --subset <path>`; it
adds `--no-cov`, without which the run fails on whole-tree coverage no matter
how the selected tests do. See [The subset-run coverage trap](#the-subset-run-coverage-trap).

If a local run drops below threshold, fix the root cause (add a test, remove
dead code, or adjust .coveragerc omit if the file is genuinely non-runtime).
Do **not** lower the threshold in the config.

## When to Run Tests

- **Backend tests**: MANDATORY for any backend code changes
- **Frontend tests**: MANDATORY for any frontend code changes
- **E2E tests**: Run on merge to main only (CI/CD pipeline)

## One source of truth per required check

`dev` branch protection requires four status checks: `Backend Tests` and
`Frontend Tests` (from `.github/workflows/test.yml`), and
`CodeQL Analysis (python)` / `CodeQL Analysis (javascript-typescript)` (the
`codeql-analysis` matrix in `.github/workflows/build.yml`). `main` requires
those four plus `Release Cut Gate`.

The set used to be eight. `Operator Docs`, `Version Consistency`,
`Semgrep Lint` and `MCP Server Tests` were dropped from branch protection in
the CI gate reduction; the first three were deleted along with the scripts
they ran, and `MCP Server Tests` still runs in `test.yml` but no longer gates
anything.

**Invariant: each of those names is emitted by exactly one job, and that job
runs on every pull request.**

### What went wrong before (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-5rwzy`)

`test.yml` triggered on `paths-ignore: ['**.md', '.beads/**']` and a sentinel
workflow, `docs-only-pass.yml`, triggered on `paths: ['**.md', '.beads/**']`.
Those two filters look like complements and are not. A pull request touching
both code and Markdown matches both, so every required context existed twice:
once real, once a job whose only step was an `echo`.

Every shipped change carries a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, so nearly every pull
request in this repo has that mixed shape. On PR #797 the duplicate went
live: `Backend Tests` reported **`failure` and `success` on the same commit**,
and the failure was a genuine test defect, not a flake. It was caught only
because the reviewer read every instance of the context individually instead
of trusting the aggregate.

### The shape that replaced it

1. Neither `test.yml` nor `build.yml` has a path filter. Both run on every
   push and pull request to `main` and `dev`.
2. A `detect` job in each classifies the changed file set by calling
   `scripts/classify_changed_paths.py`. That script holds the single
   classifier's explicit inert-path allowlist, which
   previously lived in three `paths` blocks that drifted apart.
3. Every job whose name is a required context **always runs**, so the context
   is emitted exactly once, and gates its expensive **steps** on
   `needs.detect.outputs.code_paths_changed`. On an inert machine-state change the job
   does a cheap no-op and passes honestly.
4. `docs-only-pass.yml` is deleted.

### Two rules when editing these workflows

- **Never give a required-context job a path filter or a job-level `if:` that
  can evaluate false.** GitHub counts a **skipped** job as satisfying a
  required status check, so skipping is the same hole in a new place. Gate the
  steps instead.
- **Never make a duplicate emitter fail instead.** A second check-run
  reporting failure alongside a real one that passes blocks every mixed pull
  request. The answer is one emitter, not a louder second one.

Jobs that are **not** required contexts (the image builds and scans in
`build.yml`) do skip at the job level on an inert-only change. Promoting any
of them to a required check means converting it to the step-gated shape
first. `MCP Server Tests` is the one non-required job in `test.yml` that keeps
the always-run, step-gated shape anyway, because
`publish-verified-dev-images` needs it and refuses to publish on a skipped
dependency.

`backend/tests/unit/test_classify_changed_paths.py` enforces all of this: it
pins the classifier's accept/reject boundary and its fail-open behaviour, and
it fails the pull request if a required context ever gains a second emitting
job or if `test.yml` / `build.yml` regain a path filter.

### Fail-open, on purpose

The gate expression is always `needs.detect.outputs.code_paths_changed != 'false'`. If
the `detect` job dies its output is empty, the comparison is true, and the
real work runs. Classifying code as documentation is the dangerous direction,
because it turns a required check green without running the work it is named
for. Classifying documentation as code only costs runner minutes.

### The second verdict: `docs_site_affected`

The same classifier emits a second, independent output. `docs_site_affected`
is true when a changed path is one the published user-guide site is built
from: anything under `docs/user_guide/` or `docs/images/user_guide/`, plus
`docs/index.md`, `mkdocs.yml`, `docs/requirements-docs.txt`, and
`.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml`. That list used to live in the `paths:`
filter of `docs-pages.yml`, where nothing could see it drift out of step with
the mkdocs nav. It lives in the classifier now, and `docs-pages.yml` reads it.

The two verdicts are independent, and all four combinations occur: editing
`docs/user_guide/index.md` and `mkdocs.yml` are code-gated **and**
site-affecting, `docs/testing.md` is code-gated and **not** site-affecting,
and `.beads/issues.jsonl` is inert to both.

`docs_site_affected` fails open in the **opposite** direction, to `true`. Its
dangerous verdict is a wrong `false`, which skips the rebuild and leaves the
published site stale behind merged content, so `docs-pages.yml` gates on
`!= 'false'`. A test derives the check from `mkdocs.yml` itself: every page in
the nav must be a path the classifier recognises, so adding a published page
outside the known prefixes fails the pull request rather than quietly
disabling its deploy.

### What a green required check actually ran

Because all four required checks gate their real work on
`code_paths_changed`, the check **name** is the same whether a suite ran or not.
`Backend Tests` reads as "the backend tests ran" either way.

So every required job writes one line to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` naming what it
did, and the three that produce a JUnit report run
`scripts/ci_junit_summary.py` to put the real test count in that line rather
than a claim:

```
Backend Tests: ran the backend pytest suite. 2147 tests, 0 failed, 0 errored.
Backend Tests: inert machine-state change, the pytest suite was NOT run.
```

The summary changes no conclusion and gates nothing; it makes the rollup
readable without opening each job log.

Two properties keep it from becoming a second source of untruth. Each line
reports the real `steps.<id>.outcome` of the step that does the work, so a job
that died at lint does not claim vitest ran; an outcome that is empty because
the step was never reached renders as `did not run`. And every summary step
carries `continue-on-error: true`, because it runs inside required contexts
and a cosmetic writer must never be the reason a passing suite reports red.
`ci_junit_summary.py` returns 0 on every runtime path, including a missing or
unparseable report. Argparse is the one exception: a malformed invocation
exits 2 before the script's own code runs, which is a wiring bug rather than a
runtime condition, and `continue-on-error` absorbs it either way.

`mkdocs build --strict` **no longer runs at pull-request time.** It ran as a
step of the `Operator Docs` job (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-pb2s4`), and
that job was deleted in the CI gate reduction. The strict build survives only
in `docs-pages.yml`, which runs after the merge to `dev`, so a broken
user-guide link now merges green and surfaces as a failed Pages deploy, the
exact failure mode pb2s4 was filed to remove. `npm run docs:check` is gone
too, along with `scripts/check-operator-docs.mjs`.

**The required-context contract still applies to what remains.** A required
name that no job emits blocks every open pull request permanently, not just
the one that broke it, because `enforce_admins` is true on `dev` and there is
no admin bypass. `backend/tests/unit/test_classify_changed_paths.py::TestWorkflowContract`
pins the four surviving names to the four jobs that emit them, in both
directions: a required name no job emits fails, and so does a second job that
starts emitting one.

## Container Freshness Check

**Before triaging any "test failure" report from `ecm-ecm-1`, verify the
container is actually running current `dev` HEAD.** This pattern (engineer
reports "tests failing on dev"; investigation reveals tests pass locally
and the container is stale) recurred enough times that it deserves its own
check.

The container reports its source SHA in two places, populated from
Docker build args at image-build time (`Dockerfile`: `ARG GIT_COMMIT`):

```bash
# Method A — JSON endpoint (no auth required, /api/version is exempt)
curl -s http://localhost:6100/api/version | jq -r .git_commit

# Method B — Prometheus metric label
curl -s http://localhost:6100/metrics | grep ecm_app_info
# ecm_app_info{git_sha="<sha>",release_channel="latest",version="<ver>"} 1.0
```

Compare against `origin/dev`:

```bash
git fetch origin dev
git rev-parse origin/dev
```

**If the SHAs match**, the container is current. Investigate the test
failure as real. **If they don't match**, the container is stale; redeploy
current dev HEAD before triaging:

```bash
# Backend
docker cp backend/main.py ecm-ecm-1:/app/main.py
docker cp backend/routers/. ecm-ecm-1:/app/routers/
docker restart ecm-ecm-1

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run build
docker exec ecm-ecm-1 sh -c 'rm -rf /app/static/assets/*'
docker cp dist/. ecm-ecm-1:/app/static/
```

Re-run the failing tests. If they now pass, the report was deploy drift,
not a code defect — close it without filing a code issue. The
container-first development workflow (per `CLAUDE.md`) means agents
`docker cp` specific files when iterating, so the shared `ecm-ecm-1`
container can lag origin/dev when nobody re-deploys after a merge to
`dev`. The freshness check above is a one-line cure for the entire
class of fake test-failure reports.

The same SHA labels also drive container-drift dashboards in Grafana:
`max by (git_sha) (ecm_app_info)` shows the running build identity, and
an alert can fire when it diverges from the `origin/dev` SHA published by
the build pipeline.

## Quality Gate Commands

```bash
# Backend
.venv/bin/python -m py_compile backend/main.py && scripts/backend-gate.sh

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm test && npm run build
```

`scripts/backend-gate.sh` pins the project interpreter itself and refuses to fall back to ambient `python` — which resolves an older `cryptography` and silently self-skips 9 TLS tests, so the gate would report success either way. Pin the venv for the `py_compile` call too. See [The interpreter is part of the gate](#the-interpreter-is-part-of-the-gate).

## Mock Patch Targets

When endpoints move from `main.py` to `routers/<module>.py`, test mock patches must be updated:
- `patch("main.get_client")` → `patch("routers.<module>.get_client")`
- `patch("main.get_settings")` → `patch("routers.<module>.get_settings")`
- `patch("main.journal")` → `patch("routers.<module>.journal")`
- Same for `get_session`, `get_prober`, `asyncio`, etc.

## Flake Triage Policy

Flaky tests are tests that pass and fail non-deterministically without code changes.
They are treated as **P1 bugs** (per the QA hard rules). The baseline established in
bead `enhancedchannelmanager-tp681` (2026-04-20): 3 consecutive BE + FE runs on
`dev` tip produced zero true flakes.

### What counts as a flake

A test is **flaky** if it changes outcome (pass → fail or fail → pass) across
identical re-runs without any code or data change. Common causes:

- **Timing / ordering**: races, `await asyncio.sleep(...)` assumptions,
  wall-clock comparisons.
- **Shared state**: module-level globals leaking between tests, DB rows not
  rolled back, singleton clients caching values.
- **Environmental**: test expects a file, binary, or network endpoint that is
  only sometimes present. These are **not true flakes**. They are environment
  drift and should be fixed by making the test defensive, not by re-running.

If a test fails identically every run for the same reason, it is **deterministically
broken**. Repair the test or the code. Do not mark it `flaky`.

### Re-run policy (CI & local)

| Scenario | Allowed re-runs |
|----------|-----------------|
| PR check fails on one test, passes on re-run | Re-run **once** to confirm flake. If flaky, file a `flaky`-labelled bead before merge. |
| PR check fails on same test twice in a row | Treat as deterministic break. Do not merge. |
| Local `pytest` / `vitest` reports intermittent failure | Re-run **up to twice**. If it recurs, open a bead rather than silently re-running. |

**Never** use `pytest-rerunfailures`, `vitest --retry`, or equivalent as an
automatic safety net. Retries hide flakes. They are only acceptable as a
temporary mitigation while an issue is open.

### Marking a test as a known flake

1. File a GitHub issue (`gh issue create --title "<test path>: flaky — <symptom>"`)
   and add the `flaky` label.
2. If the test blocks the suite, mark it with
   `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="flaky, see #<id>")` or
   `test.fixme(...)` in vitest. Cite the issue number in the reason string.
3. Do **not** leave `@pytest.mark.xfail` on flaky tests — xfail masks real
   regressions once the code is fixed.

### Quarterly flake sweep

Every quarter, the QA persona (or on-call engineer in its absence) runs
the 3-run cadence:

1. Pull the current `flaky`-labelled issue list.
2. Execute BE (`scripts/backend-gate.sh`) and FE
   (`npx vitest run`) three consecutive times on `dev` tip.
3. Any test that fails in exactly one of the three runs → new `flaky`-labelled
   bead (or comment on the existing one if already known).
4. Any test that fails in all three runs → it is a real regression; escalate
   to a P0/P1 bug bead in the relevant domain.
5. Revisit the open `flaky` bead list and close anything that is now passing
   three runs cleanly without code change.

### Flake baseline gate for PR reviews

The reviewer SHOULD reject a PR when the CI failure signature includes a test
in the **flagged-in-last-30-runs** list. Those are known-flaky, and the PR
needs a clean re-run (or an explicit note that the flake is unrelated to the
change).

The `Flake List PR Comment` workflow
(`.github/workflows/flake-pr-comment.yml`, bead xq19y) automates this: on PR
open / sync it walks the last 30 `Tests` workflow runs on the PR's base
branch, parses the `junit-backend` and `junit-frontend` artifacts, and posts
or updates a single PR comment listing every test that failed in at least
one of those runs. The comment is identified by a hidden marker and updated
in place, avoiding a comment-storm on rebased branches. The comment is
informational only; it does not gate merge.

Reviewer workflow:

1. Open the PR. Read the **Flake list (last 30 runs on base branch)** comment.
2. If the failing test on this PR appears in that list → re-run once. If
   still fails → investigate; probably unrelated to the PR but do not merge
   until the next CI run is green.
3. If the failing test is **not** in that list → treat as deterministic and
   block the merge until fixed.

Manual fallback (if the automation is offline): pull the list of
`flaky`-labelled open issues with `gh issue list --label flaky` and apply
the same rule.

### Known baseline flakes (as of 2026-04-20)

**Frontend (vitest):** zero flakes. 1118/1118 tests passed in three consecutive
runs on commit `a35d4f5e`.

**Backend (pytest, `--ignore=tests/e2e -m "not slow"`):** two flaky tests under
`tests/routers/test_observability_middleware.py::TestTraceIdMiddleware`:
- `test_trace_id_appears_in_log_line`
- `test_generated_trace_id_matches_uuidv4_format_in_logs`

Both pass in isolation and fail when run after the second half of
`tests/integration/`. Root cause is contextvar / logging-handler leakage from
an integration test into the observability middleware's capture fixture.
Tracked in bead **enhancedchannelmanager-hhsz0** (`flaky` label, P1).

**Not flakes, but deterministic environment drift (cleared in bead 0gcu9):**

The original three BE tests covered by `enhancedchannelmanager-0gcu9` were:
- `tests/integration/test_api_tasks.py::TestRunTaskWithSchedule::test_run_task_with_schedule_id`:
  referenced a POST route that was removed from `routers/tasks.py`. **Test
    deleted.**
- `tests/integration/test_router_registration.py::TestRoutePrefixes::test_all_routes_under_api`:
  failed because the SPA fallback route `/{full_path:path}` registers only
    when `backend/static/` exists (present in prod image, absent on CI). **Fixed
    by adding the SPA fallback path to `NON_API_ROUTES`.**
- `tests/unit/test_ffmpeg_execution.py::TestExecutionSafety::test_validates_output_path_writable`:
  the code under test promised an output-writability check its docstring
    described. **Resolved by deleting `ffmpeg_builder/execution.py` and the
    whole `test_ffmpeg_execution.py` file: the module was dead code (zero live
    callers; ECM builds ffmpeg command configs but never executes ffmpeg).**

None of these tests need deselection any longer; the 3-run cadence command
below still references the two `test_observability_middleware` flakes tracked
under `enhancedchannelmanager-hhsz0`.

### Full-suite 3-run cadence command

The exact command used for the `tp681` baseline and the quarterly sweep:

```bash
# BE — the gate, plus the flake sweep's own deselects.
scripts/backend-gate.sh \
  --deselect tests/routers/test_observability_middleware.py::TestTraceIdMiddleware::test_trace_id_appears_in_log_line \
  --deselect tests/routers/test_observability_middleware.py::TestTraceIdMiddleware::test_generated_trace_id_matches_uuidv4_format_in_logs \
  -p no:cacheprovider --tb=line

# FE — from host (ecm-ecm-1 has no Node tooling)
cd frontend && npx vitest run --reporter=default
```

Remove the relevant `--deselect` once a flake/drift bead closes.

> **Reading the deselect count here.** This sweep passes two `--deselect`s of
> its own *on top of* the gate's `-m "not slow"`, so it reports **`4
> deselected`**, not 2. That is expected and is the only invocation in this
> repo that should report 4. If a sweep run reports 2, the `--deselect` flags
> did not take effect; if a plain gate run reports 4, something is deselecting
> tests that this table does not name. Either way, find out before reading the
> run as green.
