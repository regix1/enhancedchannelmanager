# Testing Guidelines

## Test Infrastructure Overview

This project has comprehensive test coverage at three levels.

> **DBAS round-trip test environment** (ECM ↔ live Dispatcharr): a pinned,
> throwaway Dispatcharr stack + production-shaped seed tooling lives in
> [`tests/dbas-test-env/`](../tests/dbas-test-env/). Strategy and rationale:
> [`docs/testing/dbas-test-env.md`](testing/dbas-test-env.md). Use it to validate
> the round-trip success signal against a real Dispatcharr instead of the
> assumption-encoding mocks in `backend/tests/fixtures/mock_dispatcharr.py`.

## 1. Backend Tests (Python/pytest)

> **Always run backend tests under the project venv**, not a bare system
> `python3`: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` (or the path-relative equivalent
> from wherever you're running — the point is the interpreter, not the cwd).
> The project pins `cryptography` at 42+; a bare system `python3` commonly
> resolves an older `cryptography` (e.g. 41.0.7) that is missing
> `x509.Certificate.not_valid_before_utc` / `not_valid_after_utc` (added in
> cryptography 42). That gap produces 7-9 confusing failures in
> `backend/tests/unit/test_tls_storage.py` — assertion failures on subject/
> validity fields, not an obvious `AttributeError`, because the code under
> test catches the exception broadly. Two engineers independently lost time
> to this (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-vol5d`) before the affected tests
> were given a version-gated skip that names the fix in its reason string —
> if you see that skip fire, you're not on the venv interpreter.

## Backend Test Layers: `integration/` vs `routers/`

These two directories are distinct testing layers — they are not duplicates of each other.

### `backend/tests/integration/` — Shallow, mock-DB layer

Files named `test_api_<domain>.py` and other integration-scoped tests.

- **Client**: `fastapi.testclient.TestClient` (synchronous)
- **Database**: `MagicMock()` session injected via `patch("routers.<module>.get_session")`
- **Depth**: Shallow — asserts API shapes, status codes, and routing without touching real SQL
- **When to add tests here**: Verifying API contracts that can be fully expressed by mocking the DB query results; testing how the router reacts to DB-layer exceptions; lightweight smoke checks that don't require real ORM behaviour

### `backend/tests/routers/` — Deep, real-DB layer

Files named `test_<domain>.py`.

- **Client**: `httpx.AsyncClient` via the `async_client` fixture in `conftest.py` (async)
- **Database**: Real in-memory SQLite (`StaticPool`) via the `test_session` fixture — full ORM round-trips
- **Depth**: Deep — inserts real rows, exercises ORM queries, validates constraints and model
  relationships
- **When to add tests here**: Verifying that endpoints interact correctly with actual database state;
  testing model constraints, ordering, pagination, and FK relationships; any scenario where a
  MagicMock DB session would hide a real ORM bug

### Naming inversion note

Despite the directory names, the `integration/` layer is the **shallower, more-mocked** layer and the `routers/` layer is the **deeper, less-mocked** layer.  This naming reflects historical test organisation rather than the standard "integration = real dependencies" convention.  New tests added here should follow the existing pattern in each directory rather than trying to reclassify tests based on name alone.

### Acceptable duplication

A handful of trivially simple cases — `GET /some/endpoint → 404 Not Found` — are
intentionally present in both layers.  This is acceptable because each copy exercises
different machinery (sync+mock-DB vs async+real-DB) and provides independent signal.
Do not consolidate these just to reduce line count.

## Coverage ratchet cadence

Coverage is enforced in CI as a **one-way ratchet**: the current floor is the
baseline measured 2026-04-20 during bead `enhancedchannelmanager-nmlxi`, minus
a small regression buffer. Crossing below those numbers fails the CI job.

### Current thresholds

| Suite | Metric | Measured 2026-04-20 | Threshold | Buffer | Where enforced |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Backend (pytest + coverage.py) | lines | 58% | 56% | 2 pts | `backend/pytest.ini` (`--cov-fail-under=56`), paths in `backend/.coveragerc` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | statements | 15.17% | 13% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.statements` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | branches | 14.13% | 12% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.branches` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | functions | 15.28% | 13% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.functions` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | lines | 15.46% | 13% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.lines` |

Backend measurement: `docker exec ecm-ecm-1 sh -c 'cd /app && python -m pytest
--ignore=tests/e2e -m "not slow" --cov-config=/tmp/.coveragerc --cov=.
--cov-report=term'` with the three known-drift deselects from the flake
section above. 2427 tests, 3 deselected.

Frontend measurement: `cd frontend && npm run test:coverage`. 1118 tests across
44 files.

### Rationale for buffer choice

The ideal methodology (from bead `enhancedchannelmanager-nmlxi`) is to wait
~1 week after the CI test-gate landed (`enhancedchannelmanager-t8xw3`) so we
can observe real per-PR coverage numbers rather than the full-suite snapshot.
We didn't have that window — t8xw3 closed the day this bead landed. The PO
approved a single full-suite snapshot with a 2-point buffer as a pragmatic
baseline. Expect slightly churny CI on PRs that touch low-coverage modules
until the first re-ratchet.

### Re-ratchet policy

- **Cadence**: review the thresholds **2-4 weeks after this bead lands**,
  once real PR coverage data exists. Thereafter, review quarterly (aligned
  with the flake sweep).
- **Raise criterion**: if every PR merged in the review window held coverage
  comfortably (≥ threshold + 3 points) on every metric, raise that metric's
  threshold by **~5 points**. Never raise by more than 5 points in one
  review — gives authors time to respond before the ratchet tightens further.
- **Lower prohibition**: thresholds are **one-way**. Lowering requires
  explicit PO approval and a one-line rationale in the commit message. Do
  not lower "because my PR didn't quite make it" — add tests instead.
- **Per-metric independence**: frontend has four metrics (lines, branches,
  functions, statements). They ratchet independently. A PR that lifts
  function coverage to 20% should raise the function threshold to 15% —
  it does not have to wait for statements to also move.
- **Scope creep guard**: this bead's predecessor (`t8xw3`) explicitly
  excludes retroactively force-testing low-coverage modules. The ratchet
  exists to prevent regression, not to force a coverage sprint.

### Next-iteration upgrade: diff-coverage

The bead scope flagged **diff-coverage** (coverage of CHANGED lines only)
as a likely better gate for a 61K-line codebase — whole-codebase coverage
is noisy for small PRs. This is out of scope for the current ratchet bead
and should be filed as a follow-up. Candidate tools:

- Python: `diff-cover` (PyPI) integrates cleanly with coverage.xml.
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `diff-cover` also consumes v8/lcov output.

When we file the follow-up, the gate becomes "changed lines must hit X%
coverage" with X set conservatively (≥ 80% seems reasonable given the base
rates above) and the whole-codebase thresholds stay as a floor.

### Running coverage locally

```bash
# Backend — inside the container (matches the CI invocation).
docker exec ecm-ecm-1 sh -c 'cd /app && python -m pytest \
  --ignore=tests/e2e -m "not slow" --no-header -p no:warnings'
# Coverage is auto-enabled via pytest.ini addopts. To disable for a quick
# single-file run: add --no-cov.

# Frontend — from the host.
cd frontend && npm run test:coverage
```

If a local run drops below threshold, fix the root cause (add a test, remove
dead code, or adjust .coveragerc omit if the file is genuinely non-runtime).
Do **not** lower the threshold in the config.

## When to Run Tests

- **Backend tests**: MANDATORY for any backend code changes
- **Frontend tests**: MANDATORY for any frontend code changes
- **E2E tests**: Run on merge to main only (CI/CD pipeline)

## Container Freshness Check

**Before triaging any "test failure" report from `ecm-ecm-1`, verify the
container is actually running current `dev` HEAD.** This pattern (engineer
reports "tests failing on dev"; investigation reveals tests pass locally
and the container is stale) recurred enough times that it deserves its own
check.

The container reports its source SHA in two places, populated from
Docker build args at image-build time (`Dockerfile`: `ARG GIT_COMMIT`):

```bash
# Method A — JSON endpoint (no auth required, /api/version is exempt)
curl -s http://localhost:6100/api/version | jq -r .git_commit

# Method B — Prometheus metric label
curl -s http://localhost:6100/metrics | grep ecm_app_info
# ecm_app_info{git_sha="<sha>",release_channel="latest",version="<ver>"} 1.0
```

Compare against `origin/dev`:

```bash
git fetch origin dev
git rev-parse origin/dev
```

**If the SHAs match**, the container is current — investigate the test
failure as real. **If they don't match**, the container is stale; redeploy
current dev HEAD before triaging:

```bash
# Backend
docker cp backend/main.py ecm-ecm-1:/app/main.py
docker cp backend/routers/. ecm-ecm-1:/app/routers/
docker restart ecm-ecm-1

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run build
docker exec ecm-ecm-1 sh -c 'rm -rf /app/static/assets/*'
docker cp dist/. ecm-ecm-1:/app/static/
```

Re-run the failing tests. If they now pass, the report was deploy drift,
not a code defect — close it without filing a code issue. The
container-first development workflow (per `CLAUDE.md`) means agents
`docker cp` specific files when iterating, so the shared `ecm-ecm-1`
container can lag origin/dev when nobody re-deploys after a merge to
`dev`. The freshness check above is a one-line cure for the entire
class of fake test-failure reports.

The same SHA labels also drive container-drift dashboards in Grafana —
`max by (git_sha) (ecm_app_info)` shows the running build identity, and
an alert can fire when it diverges from the `origin/dev` SHA published by
the build pipeline.

## Quality Gate Commands

```bash
# Backend
python -m py_compile backend/main.py && cd backend && python -m pytest tests/ -q

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm test && npm run build
```

## Mock Patch Targets

When endpoints move from `main.py` to `routers/<module>.py`, test mock patches must be updated:
- `patch("main.get_client")` → `patch("routers.<module>.get_client")`
- `patch("main.get_settings")` → `patch("routers.<module>.get_settings")`
- `patch("main.journal")` → `patch("routers.<module>.journal")`
- Same for `get_session`, `get_prober`, `asyncio`, etc.

## Flake Triage Policy

Flaky tests — tests that pass and fail non-deterministically without code changes
— are treated as **P1 bugs** (per the QA hard rules). The baseline established in
bead `enhancedchannelmanager-tp681` (2026-04-20): 3 consecutive BE + FE runs on
`dev` tip produced zero true flakes.

### What counts as a flake

A test is **flaky** if it changes outcome (pass → fail or fail → pass) across
identical re-runs without any code or data change. Common causes:

- **Timing / ordering**: races, `await asyncio.sleep(...)` assumptions,
  wall-clock comparisons.
- **Shared state**: module-level globals leaking between tests, DB rows not
  rolled back, singleton clients caching values.
- **Environmental**: test expects a file, binary, or network endpoint that is
  only sometimes present. These are **not true flakes** — they are environment
  drift and should be fixed by making the test defensive, not by re-running.

If a test fails identically every run for the same reason, it is **deterministically
broken** — repair the test or the code. Do not mark it `flaky`.

### Re-run policy (CI & local)

| Scenario | Allowed re-runs |
|----------|-----------------|
| PR check fails on one test, passes on re-run | Re-run **once** to confirm flake. If flaky, file a `flaky`-labelled bead before merge. |
| PR check fails on same test twice in a row | Treat as deterministic break — do not merge. |
| Local `pytest` / `vitest` reports intermittent failure | Re-run **up to twice**. If it recurs, open a bead rather than silently re-running. |

**Never** use `pytest-rerunfailures`, `vitest --retry`, or equivalent as an
automatic safety net. Retries hide flakes. They are only acceptable as a
temporary mitigation while an issue is open.

### Marking a test as a known flake

1. File a GitHub issue (`gh issue create --title "<test path>: flaky — <symptom>"`)
   and add the `flaky` label.
2. If the test blocks the suite, mark it with
   `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="flaky, see #<id>")` or
   `test.fixme(...)` in vitest. Cite the issue number in the reason string.
3. Do **not** leave `@pytest.mark.xfail` on flaky tests — xfail masks real
   regressions once the code is fixed.

### Quarterly flake sweep

Every quarter, the QA persona (or on-call engineer in its absence) runs
the 3-run cadence:

1. Pull the current `flaky`-labelled issue list.
2. Execute BE (`pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e -m "not slow"`) and FE
   (`npx vitest run`) three consecutive times on `dev` tip.
3. Any test that fails in exactly one of the three runs → new `flaky`-labelled
   bead (or comment on the existing one if already known).
4. Any test that fails in all three runs → it is a real regression; escalate
   to a P0/P1 bug bead in the relevant domain.
5. Revisit the open `flaky` bead list and close anything that is now passing
   three runs cleanly without code change.

### Flake baseline gate for PR reviews

The reviewer SHOULD reject a PR when the CI failure signature includes a test
in the **flagged-in-last-30-runs** list — those are known-flaky and the PR
needs a clean re-run (or an explicit note that the flake is unrelated to the
change).

The `Flake List PR Comment` workflow
(`.github/workflows/flake-pr-comment.yml`, bead xq19y) automates this: on PR
open / sync it walks the last 30 `Tests` workflow runs on the PR's base
branch, parses the `junit-backend` and `junit-frontend` artifacts, and posts
or updates a single PR comment listing every test that failed in at least
one of those runs. The comment is identified by a hidden marker and updated
in place — no comment-storm on rebased branches. The comment is
informational only; it does not gate merge.

Reviewer workflow:

1. Open the PR. Read the **Flake list (last 30 runs on base branch)** comment.
2. If the failing test on this PR appears in that list → re-run once. If
   still fails → investigate; probably unrelated to the PR but do not merge
   until the next CI run is green.
3. If the failing test is **not** in that list → treat as deterministic and
   block the merge until fixed.

Manual fallback (if the automation is offline): pull the list of
`flaky`-labelled open issues with `gh issue list --label flaky` and apply
the same rule.

### Known baseline flakes (as of 2026-04-20)

**Frontend (vitest):** zero flakes. 1118/1118 tests passed in three consecutive
runs on commit `a35d4f5e`.

**Backend (pytest, `--ignore=tests/e2e -m "not slow"`):** two flaky tests under
`tests/routers/test_observability_middleware.py::TestTraceIdMiddleware`:
- `test_trace_id_appears_in_log_line`
- `test_generated_trace_id_matches_uuidv4_format_in_logs`

Both pass in isolation and fail when run after the second half of
`tests/integration/`. Root cause is contextvar / logging-handler leakage from
an integration test into the observability middleware's capture fixture.
Tracked in bead **enhancedchannelmanager-hhsz0** (`flaky` label, P1).

**Not flakes, but deterministic environment drift (cleared in bead 0gcu9):**

The original three BE tests covered by `enhancedchannelmanager-0gcu9` were:
- `tests/integration/test_api_tasks.py::TestRunTaskWithSchedule::test_run_task_with_schedule_id`
  — referenced a POST route that was removed from `routers/tasks.py`. **Test
    deleted.**
- `tests/integration/test_router_registration.py::TestRoutePrefixes::test_all_routes_under_api`
  — failed because the SPA fallback route `/{full_path:path}` registers only
    when `backend/static/` exists (present in prod image, absent on CI). **Fixed
    by adding the SPA fallback path to `NON_API_ROUTES`.**
- `tests/unit/test_ffmpeg_execution.py::TestExecutionSafety::test_validates_output_path_writable`
  — the code under test promised an output-writability check its docstring
    described. **Resolved by deleting `ffmpeg_builder/execution.py` and the
    whole `test_ffmpeg_execution.py` file — the module was dead code (zero live
    callers; ECM builds ffmpeg command configs but never executes ffmpeg).**

None of these tests need deselection any longer; the 3-run cadence command
below still references the two `test_observability_middleware` flakes tracked
under `enhancedchannelmanager-hhsz0`.

### Full-suite 3-run cadence command

The exact command used for the `tp681` baseline and the quarterly sweep:

```bash
# BE — from inside ecm-ecm-1
python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e \
  --deselect tests/routers/test_observability_middleware.py::TestTraceIdMiddleware::test_trace_id_appears_in_log_line \
  --deselect tests/routers/test_observability_middleware.py::TestTraceIdMiddleware::test_generated_trace_id_matches_uuidv4_format_in_logs \
  -p no:cacheprovider --tb=line -q

# FE — from host (ecm-ecm-1 has no Node tooling)
cd frontend && npx vitest run --reporter=default
```

Remove the relevant `--deselect` once a flake/drift bead closes.
