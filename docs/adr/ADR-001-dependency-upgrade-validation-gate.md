# ADR-001: Dependency Upgrade Validation Gate

> **Status note (CI gate reduction).** Two of the three gates this ADR adopted
> survive; one does not. `DAST Security Scan` (`dast-scan`) and the Checkov
> `IaC Security Scan` were removed from `.github/workflows/build.yml` by PO
> decision, so **nothing boots the candidate image or runs an OWASP ZAP
> baseline any more**. `build-amd64` and `Container Security Scan (Trivy)`
> (`trivy-scan`) both survive, alongside their ARM64 and MCP counterparts: all
> four published images are Trivy-scanned at CRITICAL/HIGH before
> `attest-image-candidates` will attest them, and therefore before anything
> publishes. What did NOT happen is this ADR's actual ask: the dependency-
> manifest `paths-filter` trigger was never implemented, and none of these
> jobs is a branch-protection required check. Branch protection on `dev`
> requires four contexts (`Backend Tests`, `Frontend Tests`, and the two
> `CodeQL Analysis` matrix legs). Everything below describes the decision as
> taken, not the pipeline as it stands.

## Scope

This ADR governs **dependency upgrades only**. It is not a general code-security gating ADR.

**In scope (ADR-001 governs):**
- PR-grouping policy for major dependency bumps (one major bump per PR — see "Dependency Upgrade PR Grouping" below).
- The PR-to-`dev` validation gate for dependency upgrades: fresh-image build (`build-amd64`), DAST `/api/health` smoke (`dast-scan`), and Trivy CRITICAL/HIGH CVE scan (`trivy-scan`), triggered via `paths-filter` on dependency manifest files (`backend/requirements*.txt`, `frontend/package*.json`, `mcp-server/requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile*`).
- Acceptance criteria for dep-bump beads under epic `bd-6rrl5`.
- Tagging convention: dep-bump PRs reference ADR-001 in the PR description.

**Out of scope (ADR-001 does NOT govern):**
- **General code-security gating** — CodeQL coverage, delta-zero enforcement on new HIGH/CRITICAL alerts, and required status checks for code scanning are governed by **ADR-005** (`enhancedchannelmanager-sm3n3`). ADR-001's `paths-filter` mechanism deliberately does NOT trigger CodeQL — non-dep-bump PRs (feature PRs, refactors, doc changes) are gated by ADR-005's CodeQL workflow, not by this ADR.
- **Release-cut `dev`→`main` promotion discipline** — governed by **ADR-004** (`enhancedchannelmanager-4lk1q`). ADR-001 only covers PR-to-`dev`.
- **Per-PR feature/refactor validation** — non-dep-bump PRs to `dev` are not subject to ADR-001's fresh-image-build gate (the `paths-filter` ensures this). They run the standard unit/integration test suite plus ADR-005's CodeQL gate.

**Relationship to ADR-005 (the boundary that mattered most in PR #82 confusion):**

ADR-001 and ADR-005 are **independent gates that both apply to dep-bump PRs** — they are not substitutes for one another:

| Gate | Source ADR | Catches | Why both must pass on a dep-bump PR |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fresh-image build + DAST smoke + Trivy | ADR-001 | Runtime regressions from dep changes (transitive resolution skew, missing build deps, ARM64/AMD64 differences, image-boot failures, CVE introductions in dep tree) | A dep bump can pass static analysis and still break the running container. CodeQL cannot see this. |
| CodeQL delta-zero + branch-protection required check | ADR-005 | New HIGH/CRITICAL static-analysis findings in code (path injection, log injection, etc.) — including findings in vendored or generated code that a dep bump may pull in | A dep bump can boot cleanly and still introduce a new injection sink in transitive code that only static analysis catches. |

The fresh-image-smoke gate (ADR-001) is the larger of the two by wall-clock and infra cost (~10–14 min vs ~2–4 min) because it must catch the broader class of *runtime* regressions that no static-analysis tool can see. The CodeQL gate (ADR-005) is narrower in cost but applies to **all** PRs to `dev`/`main`, not just dep bumps. A dep-bump PR is therefore subject to both.

## Context

The `bd-6rrl5` epic queues seven Phase-2 dependency upgrades (React 19, TypeScript 6, vite 8, jsdom 29, eslint 10, `@dnd-kit/sortable` 10, starlette 1.0 / fastapi 0.137+). Each is a major-version bump with transitive blast radius, and the epic has sat behind this ADR waiting for a validation contract.

**Corrected premise.** The parent bead's problem statement ("no CI registry push yet") is stale. Current CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) already provides, **on push to `dev` and `main`**:

1. Fresh multi-arch image build (`build-amd64`, `build-arm64`) from `Dockerfile` with `--no-cache`-equivalent clean requirements install in the `python-builder` stage.
2. Push to `ghcr.io/<repo>:{branch,sha,version}` tags.
3. Fresh-image boot + `/api/health` smoke (`dast-scan` job: `docker run`, 60s ready window, OWASP ZAP baseline).
4. CRITICAL/HIGH CVE gate (`trivy-scan`, `trivy-scan-arm64`, `ignore-unfixed: true`).
5. Backend `pip-audit` + frontend `npm audit --audit-level=high` on every push/PR to `main`.
6. Full BE (`pytest`, e2e-excluded) + FE (`npm run lint`, `typecheck`, `test`) unit+integration suites (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) on every push/PR to `dev` and `main`.

**The actual gap** is narrower and specific to dependency upgrades:

- **Pre-merge, PR-to-`dev`**: fresh-image build, DAST smoke, and Trivy scan do **not** run. Those jobs gate on `pull_request.base_ref == main` or `push` to a protected branch. A dep-bump PR targeting `dev` therefore merges on unit-test green only.
- **Dev iteration**: the CLAUDE.md loop (`docker cp + restart`, `docker exec … uv pip install …`) validates against the *mutated live venv* of `ecm-ecm-1`, not a freshly compiled `python-builder` stage. Silent skew is possible: transitive resolution differences, missing system build deps, cache-bust ordering, ARM64/AMD64 build-tool requirements (e.g. `cryptography` needs Rust on ARM64 per `Dockerfile:21-27`).

So the architectural question is not "should dep upgrades be gated?" — they already are, at merge. The question is **"should dep upgrades be gated before PR merge into `dev`, and how?"**

## Decision

**Adopt Option B: extend the existing fresh-build + DAST + Trivy jobs to run on dep-bump PRs targeting `dev`, triggered by path filters on dependency manifests.**

The mechanism already exists (`build-amd64`, `dast-scan`, `trivy-scan`) — it only needs its trigger expanded from "PR to `main`" to "PR to `main` OR (PR to `dev` with dep-manifest changes)". This is a workflow-file edit, not new infrastructure, and it is the minimum change that eliminates the silent-skew window.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons | Portability | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** — Local fresh-build contract | Each dep-bump bead requires engineer to run `docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d && curl /api/health` locally before PR; acceptance criteria references it | No new CI; forces engineer to face fresh-build failures in their own loop; zero CI minutes | Verification is honor-system (no enforcement); slow dev loop (~3–5 min/iter on ARM64 due to Rust compile); different from CI environment (runner OS, cache state) | High — pure docker | $0 infra, +~5 min/upgrade engineer time |
| **B** — Extend CI PR gate to dev-branch dep PRs (**chosen**) | Add `pull_request.branches: [main, dev]` with `paths: [backend/requirements*.txt, frontend/package-lock.json, frontend/package.json, Dockerfile*, mcp-server/requirements.txt]` to `build-amd64`, `dast-scan`, `trivy-scan` triggers; gate merge on green | Uses existing plumbing; objective and enforceable via branch-protection; fresh image is byte-identical to what `push` produces; no engineer overhead | +~5–8 min wall-clock per dep-bump PR; +~1 CI job-hour per bump (GHCR cache-from `scope=amd64` already present); requires branch-protection rule update | High — pure GitHub Actions | Negligible infra; ~$0–1/mo in runner minutes at current volume |
| **C** — Trust CI-at-push gate, document the risk | Accept that dep bumps merge to `dev` on unit-test green, rely on post-merge `build-amd64` + `dast-scan` + Trivy to catch regressions before promotion to `main` | Zero new work; simplest | A dep bump that breaks fresh-build lands on `dev`, blocks subsequent work until reverted; recovery cost > prevention cost; no clean rollback path if multiple bumps land in sequence | High — no change | $0 infra, high incident risk |
| **D** — Staging compose smoke env | Spin up a dedicated staging `docker compose` environment on each PR via self-hosted runner; smoke-test there | Closest to prod runtime; exercises full stack | Self-hosted runner not provisioned (see `bd-2lw25`); operational burden; overkill for dep validation | Medium — self-hosted runner lock-in | ~$20–40/mo runner + ops time |

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Unblocks the full `bd-6rrl5` epic** (7 dep bumps) plus `bd-6rrl5` itself and children `5x6n7, hlcgj, in620, j9xrz, lx1gf, v28b8, zqmv1`. Each bump becomes a self-contained PR with objective merge criteria.
- **Closes the silent-skew window**: CI validates the fresh-image path before merge, matching what `push`-to-`dev` will produce.
- **Cheap to reverse**: the change is a workflow YAML diff; exit path is a single-line revert.
- **No new infrastructure**: stays within GitHub-hosted runners, no vendor lock-in introduced.

### Negative
- **PR-to-dev latency** on dep bumps rises from ~4 min (unit tests only) to ~10–14 min (fresh build + DAST boot + Trivy). Acceptable — dep bumps are infrequent relative to feature PRs.
- **Runner minutes** on dep-bump PRs roughly triple. Current open-source repo uses `ubuntu-latest` free tier; remains well under quota even if multiple dep-bump PRs land per day, given the per-PR build cost.
- **Branch-protection rule for `dev`** must list the new required checks; small admin action.
- **First bump after this ADR lands** will be the canary — if any of the seven bumps silently broke fresh-build, we find out then. Recommended sequencing: run the cheapest/lowest-blast bump first (jsdom test-env-only) to validate the gate itself.

### Neutral
- Does **not** replace flake baseline (`bd-tp681`). Flake de-duplication is a prerequisite for interpreting the unit-test signal during upgrades; this ADR assumes it lands first or in parallel.
- Does **not** introduce staging or E2E-in-CI (`bd-2lw25` scope).

## Dependency Upgrade PR Grouping (Policy)

Policy is as important as the gate. PR-grouping rules, to be enforced by grooming:

- **One major bump per PR** — no trains. A PR either bumps one package (and its direct peer deps, e.g. `react` + `react-dom` + `@types/react` + `@testing-library/react` together) or nothing. Transitive churn is acceptable.
- **Minor/patch bumps**: Dependabot-style, can bundle; not gated by this ADR.
- **Security advisories**: CRITICAL/HIGH CVE fixes still require the full gate (B).

> **Note (2026-04-25):** an earlier revision of this policy capped major dep bumps at one merge to `dev` per 7-day window, on the rationale that human reviewers needed days to spot latent regressions before the next bump landed and to keep blame bisection cheap. That cadence rule has been removed (see Revision History). Branch protection serializes merges to `dev` so each merged SHA remains independently bisectable, the CI delta-zero gate (ADR-001's fresh-image smoke + ADR-005's CodeQL) catches regressions before they land rather than after, and AI-era execution makes verification cycles measured in CI minutes rather than human-observation days. The one-major-bump-per-PR grouping rule still stands — it preserves bisectability — but the per-week throttle was structurally anchored in human observation time and no longer applies.

## Application (Acceptance Criteria for `bd-6rrl5` Children)

Each dep-bump bead under `bd-6rrl5` must satisfy, as explicit acceptance:

1. **PR retargets `dev`** (current default).
2. **CI checks green on the PR**:
   - `Backend Tests`, `Frontend Tests` (existing)
   - `Build Docker Image (AMD64)` (newly triggered)
   - `DAST Security Scan` (newly triggered — `/api/health` smoke on fresh image)
   - `Container Security Scan (Trivy)` (newly triggered)
3. **No new `CRITICAL` or `HIGH` unfixed CVEs** introduced (Trivy report delta vs. `dev` tip — enforced by `trivy-scan` failing on new findings).
4. **No new flaky tests introduced**, per `bd-tp681` flake catalog.
5. **Changelog entry** drafted under `yopgt`/Keep-a-Changelog format (deferred until `bd-yopgt` scaffolds the file, at which point retrofit is acceptable).
6. **PR description** lists transitive diff delta (output of `pip-compile --diff` or `npm ls --depth=0` before/after) and notes any runtime-visible behavior changes from the package's release notes.

Items 1–4 are enforceable by branch protection. Items 5–6 are reviewer-verified.

## Implementation Sketch

Workflow changes (scope of a separate engineering bead — out of scope for this ADR):

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml (conceptual diff — not a literal patch)

# build-amd64, dast-scan, trivy-scan:
#   change:
#     if: (event=='push' && ref in [main, dev]) || (event=='pull_request' && base_ref=='main')
#   to:
#     if: (event=='push' && ref in [main, dev])
#         || (event=='pull_request' && base_ref=='main')
#         || (event=='pull_request' && base_ref=='dev' && deps-changed())
#
# where deps-changed() evaluates a dorny/paths-filter step against:
#   - backend/requirements*.txt
#   - backend/requirements.in
#   - frontend/package.json
#   - frontend/package-lock.json
#   - mcp-server/requirements.txt
#   - Dockerfile
#   - mcp-server/Dockerfile
```

Branch-protection update on `dev`: add `Build Docker Image (AMD64)`, `DAST Security Scan`, `Container Security Scan (Trivy)` as required status checks, **conditionally** (GitHub's "required if triggered" semantics — the checks are required when they run, not always). Document in `docs/shipping.md`.

## Exit Path

If Option B proves too slow or unreliable:

1. **Soft exit** — relax the path filter (e.g. exclude `Dockerfile` changes from triggering, keep only `requirements.txt`/`package-lock.json`). One-line workflow edit.
2. **Hard exit** — revert the `pull_request.branches` expansion; fall back to Option C. Workflow revert + branch-protection rule removal. ~15 minutes.

No data migration, no infrastructure teardown, no vendor relationship to unwind.

## Open Questions (Resolved by PO — 2026-04-20)

1. **Required vs. advisory on PR?** **Resolved: required.** New CI checks (`Build Docker Image (AMD64)`, `DAST Security Scan`, `Container Security Scan (Trivy)`) are required status checks on dep-bump PRs targeting `dev`, not advisory.
2. **Apply cadence policy retroactively?** **Originally resolved (2026-04-20): enforce 7-day cadence starting from this acceptance date.** **Superseded (2026-04-25): the per-week cadence rule was removed entirely (see Revision History).** The one-major-bump-per-PR grouping rule still applies; there is no longer a wall-clock spacing requirement between merged dep-bump PRs.
3. **Flake baseline sequencing.** **Resolved: `bd-tp681` (flake baseline) merges before the first dep bump.** Dep-bump unit-test signals are not interpretable without a clean flake baseline.
4. **First canary bump.** **Resolved: `bd-lx1gf` (jsdom 24→29) is the canary.** Test-env-only scope, minimal runtime blast radius, exercises the new gate end-to-end before higher-stakes bumps run through it.

## Revision History

| Date | Bead | Change | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-20 | `enhancedchannelmanager-xnqgo` | Proposed and accepted | Initial validation contract for `bd-6rrl5` epic |
| 2026-04-23 | `enhancedchannelmanager-umaop` | Scope clarification — boundary with ADR-004 / ADR-005 made explicit (see Scope) | PR #82 confusion exposed unclear gate boundaries |
| 2026-04-25 | `enhancedchannelmanager-c7txa` | **Removed the per-week cadence rule** ("at most one major bump merged to `dev` per 7-day window") | The cadence rule was structurally anchored in human review/observation time — operators needed days to spot latent regressions before the next bump landed, and bisection cheapness was the bisectability backstop. Both rationales are now obsolete: branch protection serializes merges to `dev` so each merged SHA stays independently bisectable, the CI delta-zero gate (fresh-image smoke + CodeQL) catches regressions pre-merge rather than relying on post-merge human observation, and AI-era execution makes CI cycles (minutes) the binding constraint rather than human attention (days). The one-major-bump-per-PR grouping rule is preserved — it is the bisectability guarantee that does the load-bearing work. |
