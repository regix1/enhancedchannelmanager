## Context

**What DBAS is.** DBAS (Dispatcharr Backup And Sync) is a standalone Node.js companion product
that backs up a full Dispatcharr + ECM configuration to a ZIP artifact, optionally uploads it to
cloud storage, restores it end-to-end onto a (possibly different) Dispatcharr instance, and can
sync configuration between two Dispatcharr instances. It covers **13 configuration categories**:
M3U accounts, EPG sources, channel groups, channel profiles, stream profiles, user agents, core
settings, plugins, DVR rules, comskip config, users, channels (with embedded streams), and logos.

**Why absorb it.** Maintaining DBAS as a separate Node.js app duplicates the Dispatcharr API
client, the task scheduler, the notification infrastructure, and the credential-handling surface
that ECM already implements in Python. ECM already ships a smaller-scope backup/restore precursor
(`backend/routers/backup.py` — ZIP + YAML export/restore of ECM settings + `journal.db`). Absorbing
DBAS into ECM as a first-class backup/restore subsystem retires the standalone product, removes the
duplicate maintenance surface, and gives Dispatcharr operators a single tool for full-configuration
backup, disaster recovery, and cross-instance migration.

**User value.** Operators can take a full 13-category backup, push it to durable off-host storage,
and restore the entire configuration end-to-end onto a clean Dispatcharr — for disaster recovery or
to migrate from one instance to another — without manual per-entity fix-up afterward.

**Scope of this ADR.** It governs the absorption approach for **v0.18.0**: Phase 0 (security
prerequisites), Phase 1 (backup + cloud upload), and Phase 2 (restore, all 13 categories). **Sync**
(bidirectional configuration sync between two live Dispatcharr instances) is **Phase 3, deferred to
v0.18.1** as a separate epic — but the `SyncTarget` schema lands in v0.18.0 (see D-table / Consequences).

**Estimate.** 27–46 engineer-days, single engineer, accepted by the PO.

**Prior art / superseded plan.** The original DBAS migration was the 42-bead epic `gb5r5` (filed
2026-02-18). A 2026-04-21 team-plan archaeology found it significantly overlapping already-shipped
ECM work (the `backup.py` YAML restore, `task_scheduler.py`, `dispatcharr_client.py`, the
notification infra), with 26 of 37 tree beads stale (67 days untouched) and lacking acceptance
criteria. The PO retired `gb5r5` entirely rather than salvage it, choosing to re-derive the scope
from user need. Epic `0i2vt` (this ADR) is that re-derivation.

## Decision

Absorb DBAS into ECM per the nine PO-level decisions below. Build it in three phases (Phase 0
security prerequisites → Phase 1 backup + cloud upload → Phase 2 full restore), all shipping in
**v0.18.0**; defer Sync to **v0.18.1**.

| # | Decision | What was decided |
|---|----------|------------------|
| **D1** | Artifact format | ZIP-wrapping per-category YAML + a binary subtree (per-image logo files + `metadata.json` + `url-mappings.json`) + a SHA-256 checksum file alongside the ZIP + a manifest carrying `schema_version`. **`schema_version` is mandatory from the first release.** Restore on an unknown version refuses with a user-facing `"Unsupported backup version"` (full detail server-side only). |
| **D2** | Phase-1 scope | v0.18.0 **MUST ship backup AND restore.** Backup without restore is pointless (you cannot recover from a backup you cannot apply). The two are one user-facing capability, not two releases. |
| **D3** | Credential storage | Fernet symmetric encryption via the **existing** `backend/cloud_storage/crypto.py` primitive. **No KMS for the MVP.** No new crypto surface is introduced. *(Note 2026-06-16: **D12 partially supersedes this** — optional whole-artifact passphrase encryption introduces a new KDF+AEAD surface for the opt-in cred-carrying path. D3 still governs at-rest credential storage.)* |
| **D4** | Outbound URL policy | A **first-run SSRF wizard** (LAN-friendly default: RFC1918 + RFC 6598 shared space + loopback allowed; public-only mode blocks them) + an **always-on denylist** (metadata/link-local/other IPv6-special/non-`http(s)` schemes, rejected in *both* modes, no opt-out) + **DNS-rebinding mitigations** (resolve-then-connect-by-IP, redirect re-validation). |
| **D5** | Progress transport | **HTTP polling**, reusing `task_scheduler` + the NotificationCenter. **WebSocket is NOT ported** from DBAS. |
| **D6** | Release sequencing | **v0.18.0 (DBAS) then v0.18.1 (Sync), sequential**, per the ADR-004 "one major thing per cut" discipline. DBAS is the sole major item of v0.18.0; Sync is the sole major item of v0.18.1. |
| **D7** | Dry-run engine | **Counts-only** (would-create / would-update / would-skip per entity per action). The full entity-level diff tree is **deferred to v0.19.x.** Dry-run is **default-ON** for Dispatcharr restores (opt in to apply; cannot opt out of the dry-run guardrail). |
| **D8** | Logo memory model | **Streaming upload** pattern (read one logo → decode → upload → release before the next), **not** a port of DBAS's `CumulativeMemoryTracker`. Re-evaluable at implementation kickoff. |
| **D9** | Logo-miss severity | A logo that cannot be matched on restore produces a **WARN log + an aggregate count + a prominent red banner on the restore-complete screen** — not a silent DEBUG line. |
| **D10** | Plugins scope | *(**AMENDED 2026-08-23 by [the plugin-determination amendment](#amendment-2026-08-23-d10s-premise-measured--plugins-are-code-and-config-and-the-two-separate-cleanly-bead-enhancedchannelmanager-ne0gf) -> D10': the RCE surface is CONFIRMED for plugin CODE, which stays excluded; plugin CONFIGURATION is measured separable and is NOT excluded.**)* **Plugins are EXCLUDED from v0.18.0** backup/restore (RCE-surface unknown; sidesteps the question and unblocks the rest of `0i2vt.13`). Revisit once plugin semantics are understood. *(Added 2026-06-16; full rationale in the Amendment below.)* |
| **D11** | Cross-instance restore | **IN SCOPE for v0.18.0.** The archive is **trusted operator input**, but always-on safety validations apply regardless of source (SSRF denylist on every URL, schema validation, never restore a foreign admin that locks out the current operator). No archive signing/provenance for a self-hosted LAN tool. *(Added 2026-06-16; rationale in the Amendment.)* |
| **D12** | Passphrase encryption | **Optional whole-artifact passphrase encryption SHIPS in v0.18.0** (overrides the architect's defer recommendation) so credentials travel with a cross-instance migration (pairs with D11). Opt-in; redact-by-default (D1) stays the default. Introduces a new KDF+AEAD surface (**partially supersedes D3**) and a decrypt path across all Phase-2 restore beads. *(Added 2026-06-16. Grooming 2026-06-17: design-gated — crypto spike `0zrse` precedes build; v0.18.0-vs-v0.18.1 placement decided on spike output. Rationale in the Amendment.)* |

### Five open questions — all resolved inline at decision time (2026-04-21)

| Q | Question | Resolution |
|---|----------|------------|
| Q1 | Scope of the v0.18.0 deliverable | **Full round-trip** (backup + restore, all 13 categories). |
| Q2 | Engineer-day estimate | **27–46 engineer-days accepted** by the PO (2026-04-21). *(Stale as of 2026-06-17: this predates D10/D11/D12. Grooming put the D12-in range at ~37–60 days. UNDER REVISION — re-estimate pending the `0zrse` crypto-spike outcome, since D12's v0.18.0-vs-.1 placement is the largest swing. v0.18.0 scope also narrowed: Dropbox/OneDrive cloud targets deferred, leaving S3/WebDAV/GDrive.)* |
| Q3 | SSRF wizard default | **LAN-friendly** (many operators back up to a NAS on `192.168.x.x`). |
| Q4 | Dry-run depth | **Counts-only** for v0.18.0; full diff tree deferred to v0.19.x (= D7). |
| Q5 | Logo-miss visibility | **Prominent red banner** on restore-complete (= D9). |

### Phase breakdown (as decomposed in epic `0i2vt`)

- **Phase 0 — security prerequisites** (`0i2vt.1`, `.2`, `.3`): redact secrets in the existing ZIP
  export path (`.1`, already shipped, rescoped to `l0nhi`); Fernet-key bootstrap integrity check
  (mode 0600 + ownership) (`.2`); STRIDE addenda for export-artifact redaction + outbound
  destinations (`.3`, drafted into `docs/security/threat_model_dbas_import.md` Addenda A & B).
- **Phase 1 — backup + cloud upload** (`0i2vt.4`–`.9`): `SyncTarget` + `CloudTarget` models with
  Fernet-encrypted credentials (`.4`); first-run SSRF wizard + denylist + DNS-rebinding (`.5`);
  scheduled + manual backup via `task_scheduler` (`.6`); ZIP artifact builder with
  `schema_version` + SHA-256 + manifest (`.7`); cloud upload wiring (S3 / OneDrive / Dropbox /
  GDrive / WebDAV) (`.8`); retention policy (last-N + time-based) (`.9`).
- **Phase 2 — restore, 13 categories** (`0i2vt.10`–`.20`): M3U accounts importer (`.10`); EPG
  sources (`.11`); bulk importer for groups + channel profiles + stream profiles (`.12`); bulk
  importer for user agents + core settings + plugins + DVR + comskip + users (`.13`); channels
  importer with 4-tier stream matching + custom-stream fallback (`.14`); logos importer (`.15`);
  dry-run engine (`.16`); schema-version validation (`.17`); pre-flight validation +
  compensating-delete rollback (`.18`); restore-complete UX — logo-miss red banner (`.19`) +
  per-entity summary counts (`.20`).

  **Hard ordering inside Phase 2:** M3U → EPG → Channels → Logos (an entity cannot restore before
  the entities it references).

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Single tool, single maintenance surface.** Retires the standalone DBAS Node.js app; the
  Dispatcharr client, scheduler, notifications, and credential handling are reused, not duplicated.
- **No new crypto, no new transport.** D3 reuses the shipped Fernet primitive; D5 reuses the
  shipped task-scheduler + notification-polling path. Both decisions minimize new attack surface
  and new operational surface — consistent with the single-container model.
- **Forward-compatible artifacts.** D1's mandatory `schema_version` means a future ECM can detect
  an older artifact and route to a migrator rather than silently misapplying it; the SHA-256
  protects against transport corruption on cloud round-trips.
- **Restore is guard-railed.** D7's default-ON counts-only dry-run answers "am I about to wreck my
  setup?" at near-zero engineering cost; D9's red banner makes logo misses impossible to overlook.
- **Schema lands once.** `SyncTarget` is defined in v0.18.0 (D-table / `0i2vt.4`) even though Sync
  ships in v0.18.1, so the v0.18.1 cut is not gated on a migration.

### Negative / costs

- **Large epic, 27–46 days.** Even sub-phased, this is the biggest single capability ECM has taken
  on. Phase 2 alone has 11 children, two of which (`.14` Channels, `.15` Logos) are 4–8 days each.
- **No local transaction across the Dispatcharr REST boundary.** Dispatcharr has no database
  transactions ECM can join, so restore consistency is best-effort: pre-flight validation +
  compensating-delete rollback (D-implied, `0i2vt.18`). This is weaker than an ACID restore and the
  failure modes must be surfaced explicitly to the operator (partial-state reporting), not hidden.
- **Outbound egress is a new trust boundary.** v0.18.0 deliberately makes ECM connect to
  operator-typed URLs (cloud endpoints, WebDAV base URLs, eventually Sync targets). D4's SSRF
  controls are mandatory, not optional, and the always-on denylist must be un-disableable.
- **`CumulativeMemoryTracker` deliberately not ported (D8).** The streaming pattern must survive a
  100 GB policy ceiling (50 MB × 2000 logos) without OOM in a single-process container; this is an
  implementation risk to validate at `0i2vt.15` kickoff.

### Exit path

- **Whole feature**: the subsystem is additive — new routers, new models, new tasks. Backing it out
  is dropping the routers from `all_routers`, the tasks from the registry, and the
  `SyncTarget`/`CloudTarget` tables via a down-migration. No infrastructure to unwind, no vendor
  relationship, no data other operators depend on.
- **D8 (streaming)**: if streaming proves insufficient at scale, the `CumulativeMemoryTracker` port
  is the documented fallback (D8 says "re-evaluable at kickoff").
- **D5 (HTTP polling)**: if polling proves inadequate for progress UX, a WebSocket/SSE transport can
  be added later; the task/notification model does not preclude it.

## Alternatives Considered

| # | Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|---|--------|------|------|----------|
| 1 | **Keep DBAS as a standalone Node.js companion** | No absorption work; DBAS already exists | Duplicates ECM's Dispatcharr client / scheduler / notifications / credential handling; second deploy artifact; two codebases drift | Rejected — duplicate maintenance surface is the whole reason to absorb |
| 2 | **The retired 42-bead `gb5r5` plan** (port DBAS 1:1, Sync included up front) | Comprehensive; mirrors DBAS feature-for-feature | 26/37 beads stale, no acceptance criteria, significant overlap with already-shipped ECM work, Sync coupled to the first cut (violates ADR-004 one-major-thing) | **Retired 2026-04-21** — re-derived from user need as epic `0i2vt` |
| 3 | **Backup-only in v0.18.0, restore in v0.18.1** | Smaller first cut | A backup you cannot restore has no user value; splits one capability across two releases | Rejected by **D2** (backup AND restore ship together) |
| 4 | **Full entity-level diff tree for dry-run in v0.18.0** | Richest "what will change" preview | Expensive to build; counts-only answers the safety question at a fraction of the cost | Rejected by **D7** (counts-only; diff tree deferred to v0.19.x) |
| 5 | **KMS-backed credential storage** | Stronger key custody | No KMS in the single-container deployment model; over-engineered for the MVP | Rejected by **D3** (Fernet via existing `crypto.py`); KMS revisitable post-MVP |
| 6 | **Port DBAS's WebSocket progress transport** | Live push, no poll latency | ECM has no WebSocket backend today; adds a transport + scaling surface for a single-process app; the notification-poll path already exists | Rejected by **D5** (HTTP polling, reuse task_scheduler + NotificationCenter) |
| 7 | **Port `CumulativeMemoryTracker` for logos** | Bounded cumulative memory accounting | Heavier than needed; streaming (read-decode-upload-release per file) bounds memory to one logo at a time | Rejected by **D8** (streaming), re-evaluable at kickoff |
| 8 | **Optional `schema_version` (add it later when needed)** | Slightly less work day one | A v0.18.0 artifact with no version is un-migratable by a future ECM — the cost lands forever later | Rejected by **D1** (mandatory from first release) |

- **Task substrate**: `backend/task_scheduler.py` / `backend/task_engine.py` — the scheduled/manual

- **Cloud adapters**: `backend/cloud_storage/factory.py` + `s3_adapter.py` / `onedrive_adapter.py`
  / `dropbox_adapter.py` / `gdrive_adapter.py` — the upload substrate `0i2vt.8` extends (WebDAV
  adapter to be added).

## Amendment — 2026-06-16 PO decisions (ADR-formalization review, bead `07lfx`)

The IT-architect review of epic `0i2vt` (bead `07lfx`) endorsed the approach and surfaced three
decisions that the PO resolved on 2026-06-16. They extend D1–D9:

| # | Decision | Rationale / impact |
|---|----------|--------------------|
| **D10** | **Plugins are EXCLUDED from v0.18.0 backup/restore.** *(**AMENDED 2026-08-23 -> D10': split. See [the plugin-determination amendment](#amendment-2026-08-23-d10s-premise-measured--plugins-are-code-and-config-and-the-two-separate-cleanly-bead-enhancedchannelmanager-ne0gf).**)* | We do not yet know whether a Dispatcharr "plugin" is executable code (RCE surface on restore) or declarative config (`grep plugin backend/` = 0 hits). Excluding it sidesteps the RCE question entirely and unblocks the rest of `0i2vt.13` (settings/DVR/comskip/users/agents). Revisit in a later release once plugin semantics are understood. `0i2vt.13` drops the plugins category. **The premise italicised above was measured on 2026-08-23 and was half right: the code IS an RCE surface (`spec.loader.exec_module`), and the configuration is separable, API-reachable and harmless. The `grep` cited here searched ECM's tree, not Dispatcharr's.** |
| **D11** | **Cross-instance restore is IN SCOPE for v0.18.0.** The archive is treated as **trusted operator input** (same trust as the operator typing config), but the always-on safety validations apply **regardless of source**: SSRF denylist on every URL, schema validation, and never restoring a foreign admin that locks out the current operator. | The epic's headline value is migration (back up instance A, restore onto instance B). Full untrusted-archive provenance/signature checking is overkill for a self-hosted single-operator LAN tool; operator-trusted-input + unconditional safety guards is the right posture. The threat model (currently same-instance-scoped, Draft) must be re-pointed at this ADR and lifted out of Draft to cover the cross-instance case. |
| **D12** | **Optional whole-artifact passphrase encryption SHIPS in v0.18.0** (overrides the architect's recommendation to defer to v0.18.x). | So credentials travel with a cross-instance migration instead of being re-entered on the target (pairs with D11). This ADDS scope to v0.18.0: passphrase → key-derivation (e.g. scrypt/PBKDF2), lost-passphrase handling (unrecoverable — must be made explicit to the operator), and the encrypt/decrypt UX on backup + restore. The redact-by-default path (D1) remains the default; passphrase encryption is opt-in for operators who want secrets included. Needs dedicated design at grooming. A new bead covers it. |

These are recorded as PO-accepted. The threat model and the affected child beads (`0i2vt.13`,
the new passphrase-encryption bead, `0i2vt.7`/restore) are updated to match.

## Amendment, 2026-08-17: "redact by default" covers structured credentials (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-gi4zn`)

PO decision, 2026-08-05, implemented 2026-08-17. This does not overturn a decision above; it fixes
what one of them was taken to mean, after a live drill showed the shipped behaviour was narrower
than the words.

**Reading note first.** D12 and the threat model both cite "redact-by-default (D1)". D1 as
recorded in the decision table is the **artifact format** decision and says nothing about
redaction, so a reader chasing that citation finds nothing. Read those citations as pointing at
the redact-by-default *posture* the epic carried from the start, now specified here.

**What redact-by-default now means.** A standard (non-encrypted, default) artifact carries no
value that identifies **or** authenticates against a third-party service, and no ECM
authentication state. Not "the password field is redacted". The 2026-08-05 drill found an Xtream
Codes `username` in clear beside a correctly redacted `password`: for that provider the username
is half the credential pair and the half that names the subscription, so an artifact carrying it
was not a redacted artifact. Enumerating a real artifact against the corrected rule found five
more instances of the same protected-beside-unprotected asymmetry, three bearer credentials an
exact-name denylist had never matched, and (after external review) ECM's own `users` table
complete with the operator's bcrypt admin hash.

Three consequences for this ADR's decisions:

| Decision | What changes |
|---|---|
| **D1 / redact-by-default** | Specified as the property above rather than as a field list. Implemented as three rules in one place: a credential-class key denylist, provider-identity keys (`username`), and a value-level URL credential scrub. Identity redaction is on by default so a new caller fails closed; there is exactly one exemption, `dispatcharr_users`, whose username is the operator's own instance and the natural key its importer creates and collision-checks on. |
| **D12 / preserve set** | The cred-carrying encrypted artifact is unaffected, and that required a deliberate widening: the provider-identity keys join its **preserve set** (`_REDACT_KEYS` plus `_PROVIDER_IDENTITY_KEYS`), and the URL scrub is off on that path. Half a credential pair is not a credential, so omitting them would have widened redaction into the one artifact D12 exists to leave alone. `password_hash` is in neither the denylist nor the preserve set and is never carried by a category; the encrypted artifact carries the operator's accounts through its byte-for-byte `journal.db` copy instead. |
| **D3 / at-rest ciphertext** | Unchanged as a storage decision, but `cloud_storage_targets` and `sync_targets` are now dropped from a standard artifact entirely. Fernet ciphertext is still credential material in an artifact whose purpose is to remove working credentials before export. Operator-authored configuration remains and still requires a disclosure review. |

**The `journal.db` scrub is now an allowlist.** Three review rounds each found more tables that
should not ship, which is the failure mode of any denylist maintained by people who keep
discovering it is incomplete. Fourteen named tables may ship, each with its reason recorded beside
the entry; every other table is dropped and the file is `VACUUM`ed. Thirty further model-declared
tables carry an explicit drop decision, and a test fails when a model declares a table classified
in neither, so a new table cannot reach production unclassified. Both registries live in the
source rather than in a doc, because the test reads them.

**The scrub fails closed.** Every error path in it previously fell back to shipping the raw
database behind a `200`. A backup whose `journal.db` cannot be read now fails outright and writes
no artifact. This is a deliberate availability-for-confidentiality trade on the producer side
only; the restore side stays best-effort, because there the worst case is the operator running
first-run setup.

**Operator-facing effect, and a compatibility constraint.** A standard artifact is now safe to
attach to a support ticket. Restoring one onto an instance with no ECM accounts lands at first-run
setup, and restoring onto an instance that has accounts leaves them alone; the restore response
carries `notices` naming what this instance actually lost. Because `schema_version` did not move,
nothing refuses a new artifact being restored by an older build, and that combination has three
gaps that cannot be fixed retroactively. See the compatibility note in
`docs/security/threat_model_dbas_import.md` §8.5 and the operator-facing version in
`docs/user_guide/backup-restore/backup-overview.md`.

## Amendment, 2026-08-23: D10's premise measured — plugins are code AND config, and the two separate cleanly (bead `enhancedchannelmanager-ne0gf`)

- **Status**: Accepted. Amends **D10**, which is now **split rather than blanket**.
- **What changed**: nothing about the world; D10 rested on an explicitly unmeasured premise
  (*"we do not yet know whether a Dispatcharr 'plugin' is executable code … or declarative
  config"*) and that premise has now been measured against `ghcr.io/dispatcharr/dispatcharr:latest`.
  D10's original rationale cited `grep plugin backend/` = 0 hits — a search of **ECM's** tree,
  which could not answer a question about **Dispatcharr's**. That is the gap this amendment closes.

### The measurement

Run 2026-08-23 against a disposable account/plugin on the `dbas-sync-testenv` Dispatcharr **B**
instance (`ghcr.io/dispatcharr/dispatcharr:latest`), all fixtures removed afterward.

**A plugin is both, and the halves live in different places.**

| Half | Where it lives | Reachable over the API? |
|---|---|---|
| **Code** | `/data/plugins/<key>/plugin.py` (or a package `__init__.py`), plus `plugin.json`, optional `logo.png` — **on disk, in the container** | Only as an opaque **zip upload** (`POST /api/plugins/plugins/import/`) or an install-by-reference from a signed repo manifest (`POST /api/plugins/repos/install/`). The code itself is never *readable* through the API. |
| **Configuration** | `plugins_pluginconfig` row: `key`, `name`, `version`, `description`, `enabled`, `ever_enabled`, `settings` (JSON) — **in Postgres** | Yes, fully: `GET /api/plugins/plugins/`, `POST /api/plugins/plugins/<key>/settings/`, `POST /api/plugins/plugins/<key>/enabled/`. |

**Replicating code means shipping executable code, and Dispatcharr says so itself.**
`apps/plugins/loader.py::_load_module_from_path` ends in `spec.loader.exec_module(module)` —
plugin files are imported into the running Django process. Measured directly: a probe plugin whose
`plugin.py` wrote a marker file at *module* scope produced that marker the moment an action ran
(`PluginManager.run_action` → `{"status": "ok", …}`, marker present). Dispatcharr's own
`Plugins.md` states it plainly: *"Treat plugins as trusted code: they run with full app
permissions"*, and the UI shows a first-enable trust modal *"explaining that plugins can run
arbitrary server-side code."* **D10's suspected RCE surface is real. The exclusion of plugin CODE
survives on a named harm, no longer on an unknown.**

**Configuration separates cleanly from code, and this is the half D10 was wrong to sweep up.**
Three measured facts:

1. `loader.py::_sync_db_with_registry` only ever `get_or_create`s and updates. **It never deletes a
   `PluginConfig` row whose code is absent from disk.** A config row written to an instance that
   does not have the plugin installed *persists indefinitely*.
2. Dispatcharr **already reports** that state. A seeded config row with no code on disk came back
   from `GET /api/plugins/plugins/` as `"missing": true, "loaded": false`, and the shipped
   `PluginCard` bundle branches on `e.missing`. The operator-facing surface for a
   config-without-code plugin exists upstream; ECM does not have to invent one.
3. When the code later arrives, **the pre-existing settings win**. A row seeded with
   `{"limit": 99, "note": "replicated-from-A", "mode": "fast"}` was still exactly that after the
   plugin was installed and rediscovered — *not* reset to the manifest defaults
   (`5` / `""` / `"safe"`), and `missing` flipped to `false`.

**One field is its own harm, and it is not `settings`.** The trust modal is gated on
`ever_enabled`: the built `PluginCard` reads
`if (t && !e.ever_enabled && r && !await r(e)) { … }`. Replicating `ever_enabled: true` (or
`enabled: true`) to a destination therefore **permanently suppresses the "this runs arbitrary
server-side code" confirmation** for that plugin on that instance. Those two flags are a
privilege/consent decision about the destination, in the same harm class as `users` and
`network_access` in ADR-013 — not configuration.

### D10, restated

**Plugin CODE stays excluded** — from backup/restore and from sync — on a **confirmed** harm:
replication would write executable Python to a destination's `/data/plugins`, which Dispatcharr
imports into its own server process with full application permissions. That is remote code
execution by construction, and an archive is only *operator-trusted* input (D11), which is a
weaker warrant than "may execute arbitrary code on the destination". Install-by-reference from the
signed official repo manifest is the upstream-sanctioned path and remains an operator action, not
an ECM one.

**Plugin CONFIGURATION (`settings`, and the `key`/`name`/`version` identity it hangs on) is NOT
excluded.** It is ordinary declarative state, it is fully reachable over the API, it survives on a
destination that lacks the code, it is adopted when the code arrives, and Dispatcharr already
renders the interim state as `missing`. Under ADR-013's faithful-copy principle a replica that
silently loses every plugin setting is unfaithful, and nothing about that half is harmful.
Excluding it was collateral from the unmeasured code question.

**`enabled` and `ever_enabled` are excluded on their own named harm** (trust-modal suppression),
separately from both of the above. A replicated plugin config must land disabled and
never-yet-enabled, leaving the destination operator to make the consent decision the modal exists
to obtain.

`0i2vt.13` keeping no plugins category was correct for the code half and wrong for the config
half. The remaining build work, and the operator-facing statement of the code-half exclusion, are
tracked on `enhancedchannelmanager-ne0gf`.
