"""Regression tests for y3m6o.1 review (build 0.17.6-0152) — run_channel_pipeline
poll-loop terminal-status handling.

Blocker 2: ``_TERMINAL_STATUSES`` omitted ``completed_with_errors``, ``capped``,
and ``abandoned``, so a run finalizing in any of those states was polled all
until the timeout and then falsely reported "still running". These tests prove:

  * EACH real terminal status a ChannelPipelineExecution can persist exits the
    poll loop on the FIRST poll — no timeout, exactly one status poll. The
    EXHAUSTIVE persisted-terminal set is completed, failed, rolled_back, capped,
    completed_with_errors, abandoned. ``abandoned`` is persisted by
    task_engine's startup crash-reconciliation (GH #473 / bd-exo4j), NOT a
    task_engine-only concept — an earlier revision of this file omitted it,
    which was a genuine miss.
  * A ``completed_with_errors`` terminal result surfaces the failed-action
    warning/error summary (error_message) to the caller rather than a generic
    "complete".
  * A ``capped`` terminal result surfaces its cap guidance.
  * An ``abandoned`` terminal result surfaces the interrupted outcome + its
    "Abandoned: run was interrupted…" error_message.
