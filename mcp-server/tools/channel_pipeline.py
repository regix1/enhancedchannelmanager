"""Channel pipeline (formerly "auto-creation") tools.

The 13 primary tools were renamed from ``*_auto_creation*`` to
``*_channel_pipeline*`` (enhancedchannelmanager-3udrl Phase 3). The old names
stay registered as thin deprecated aliases that forward to the new
implementations — see each alias's docstring for its ``[DEPRECATED — use ...
instead]`` pointer. Remove the aliases in a later dated release once callers
have migrated (tracking bead to be filed after this phase ships).

# ``abandoned`` IS a persisted pipeline-execution status, NOT a task_engine-only
# concept (an earlier version of this comment claimed otherwise — that was a
# genuine miss: task_engine._abandon_orphaned_auto_creation_executions
# transitions in-flight ChannelPipelineExecution rows from 'running' ->
# 'abandoned' on startup crash-reconciliation, GH #473 / bd-exo4j). ECM and the
# MCP server are separate processes, so the MCP poller survives the backend
# restart that mints the abandoned row and would otherwise poll it all
# _POLL_MAX_ATTEMPTS times, then falsely report "still running" — the same
# false-polling defect we fixed for completed_with_errors/capped (y3m6o.1

        Args:

            conditions: List of condition dicts. Each has 'type', 'value', optional 'connector'
                ("and"/"or"), optional 'negate' (bool, inverts the match — see below), and
                optional 'case_sensitive' (bool, string/regex types only).
                Condition types:
                  stream_name_contains — substring match on stream name
                  stream_name_matches — regex match on stream name
                  stream_group_contains — substring match on group name
                  stream_group_matches — regex match on group name
                  stream_group_is — EXACT match on the stream's provider group
                    (value = the M3U group_title string, e.g. "USA Sports" — NOT
                    the group id used by channel_in_group/normalized_name_in_group).
                    Case-insensitive by default; set case_sensitive=true to require
                    exact case. Caveats: (1) if two M3U accounts happen to use the
                    same group name, this condition matches streams from BOTH —
                    combine with provider_is to scope to one account; (2) if the
                    provider renames the group upstream, this condition silently
                    stops matching (no error — the group name just no longer
                    appears on any stream).
                  provider_is — from specific M3U account (value = account ID)
                  tvg_id_exists — stream has EPG ID (no value needed)
                  tvg_id_matches — regex match on EPG ID
                  logo_exists — stream has logo URL
                  quality_min / quality_max — min/max resolution height
                  codec_is — video codec filter
                  has_audio_tracks — minimum audio tracks
                  has_channel — stream already assigned to a channel
                  channel_exists_with_name — exact channel name exists
                  channel_exists_matching — regex match on existing channels
                  normalized_name_in_group / normalized_name_not_in_group —
                    STREAM-side: fire only when the triggering stream's
                    normalized name IS (or is NOT) already present in group N.
                    These gate whether the rule FIRES; they do NOT constrain
                    which existing channel a merge_streams action targets. To
                    keep merges OUT of a group, use the merge_streams action's
                    target_channel_not_in_group param (see actions below).
                  normalized_name_exists / normalized_name_not_exists
                  always / never — always or never matches
                'negate': true inverts ANY condition's result — this is how to express
                  exclusions. Most useful on the regex (_matches) types for a "does NOT
                  match this regex" filter, e.g. exclude everything matching a pattern:
                  {"type": "stream_name_matches", "value": "(?i)test|demo", "negate": true}
                  Also works on non-regex types, e.g. {"type": "provider_is", "value": 3,
                  "negate": true} means "NOT from M3U account 3".
                Example: [{"type": "stream_group_contains", "value": "USA | Entertainment", "connector": "and"}]
            actions: List of action dicts. Each has 'type' and type-specific fields.
                Action types:
                  create_group — params: name_template, if_exists (skip/use_existing)
                  create_channel — params: name_template, if_exists (skip/merge/merge_only/update),
                                   channel_number (e.g. "800-99999" for range)
                  merge_streams — params: target (auto/existing_channel/new_channel),
                                   find_channel_by (name_exact/name_regex/tvg_id) + find_channel_value,
                                   max_streams_per_channel, remove_non_matching (bool),
                                   loose_name_match (bool, default false). With target=auto the
                                   stream merges into an existing channel only on EXACT normalized-
                                   name equality; set loose_name_match=true to restore the legacy
                                   fuzzy cascade (core-name/deparen/word-prefix/call-sign).
                                   SCORED FUZZY (OTA/callsign locals): set loose_name_match=true AND
                                   min_score (float, 0.60-1.00) to use the unified scoring core
                                   instead of the legacy cascade. The scored path applies a callsign
                                   HARD-REJECT (a WBAY stream never merges into a WGBA channel
                                   regardless of name similarity), a tvg_id-callsign override, and a
                                   Locals fuzzy fallback. A scored-fuzzy rule REQUIRES a non-empty
                                   target_channel_in_group allowlist (it is refused otherwise) and,
                                   by default, a parseable callsign on BOTH sides; set
                                   allow_no_callsign=true to admit no-callsign pairs (only at
                                   score>=0.90). Optional tie_break (lowest_id/highest_score) and
                                   max_candidates. Per-merge score + provenance is written to the
                                   journal. Legacy loose rules WITHOUT min_score are unchanged.
                                   NOTE: match_by is a DEPRECATED no-op (validated but never
                                   consumed at runtime) — use loose_name_match to control matching.
                                   target_channel_not_in_group (list[int], default absent) — TARGET-
                                   channel group filter: after the merge target is resolved, SKIP
                                   the merge if the resolved channel's group is in this list. This
                                   is the "keep merges OUT of group N" guard (the stream-side
                                   normalized_name_not_in_group condition cannot do this). Optional
                                   complement target_channel_in_group (list[int]) only merges when
                                   the resolved channel's group IS in the list. Both default to
                                   absent (no filter); they ride inside the action dict.

                  sort_group — GROUP-level post-run pass (NOT per-stream):
                    alphabetically sorts and renumbers ALL channels in a
                    group, once per group per run, after every stream has
                    been processed — the automated equivalent of the
                    manual Channel Manager "Sort & Renumber" tool. Params
                    (all optional): order ("asc"/"desc", default "asc"),
                    starting_number (int >= 1; default = the group's
                    current lowest channel number, or 1 if none is set),
                    strip_numbers (bool, default true — ignore embedded
                    channel numbers in names when sorting, e.g. "209 |
                    A&E"), ignore_country (bool, default false — ignore a
                    leading country prefix like "US | " / "UK: " when
                    sorting), group_id (int, optional explicit target
                    group — otherwise resolved from the current stream's
                    channel/group context, falling back to the rule's
                    target_group_id). Sort order is natural (case-
                    insensitive, "Channel 2" before "Channel 10") and
                    matches the manual Sort & Renumber tool exactly. If
                    the group can't be resolved (e.g. sort_group is the
                    rule's ONLY action with no target_group_id set and no
                    prior create_channel/merge_streams action), the
                    action fails for that stream with an explanatory
                    error — it does not silently no-op.
                  skip — skip this stream
                  stop_processing — stop processing further rules
                  log_match — log when matched
                Example: [{"type": "create_group", "name_template": "Entertainment", "if_exists": "use_existing"},

        This is the FULLER revert (vs rollback_channel_pipeline). It restores the
        entire snapshotted channel<->stream state captured BEFORE the run mutated
        anything: re-adds streams the run REMOVED, removes streams it added,
        restores drifted metadata (channel group / EPG link / tvg id). Only runs
        that captured a snapshot are eligible — check list_channel_pipeline_executions

        SAFETY — OPTIMISTIC OVERWRITE, NOT UNDOABLE (ADR-010 §D5):
        A restore spans EVERY channel in the snapshot (often hundreds). It

        made AFTER the run and BEFORE this revert is LOST. There is no conflict
        detection and the restore CANNOT be undone.

          - confirm=False (default) → NOTHING is restored. The tool returns the
            warning (including how many channels would be overwritten, when the
            snapshot was taken) and tells you to re-invoke with confirm=true.
          - confirm=true → the restore runs. Partial failures (a channel deleted
            since the run, a stream id that no longer resolves) are SURFACED
            per-channel — never a silent partial success.

        group's channels and the secondary groups' streams from Dispatcharr,
        and scores every stream through the EXACT resolver the future attach
        path will use. Nothing is merged, mutated, or toggled.

        Provide EXACTLY ONE of:
            rule_id: Preview a saved event_sync rule.
            event_sync_config: Preview an inline config before saving. The
                canonical scoping is provider-scoped:
                {"master": {"group_id": int, "m3u_account_id": int | null},
                 "secondary": [{"group_id": int, "m3u_account_id": int|null},

                 "include_master_group_streams"/"assume_current_date"/
                 "parse_master_from_stream"}.
                A scope's m3u_account_id (null = whole group) draws streams
                from ONE M3U provider, so provider A's copy of a group can be
                the master while provider B's copy of the SAME group is a
                secondary. The legacy flat shape
                {"master_group_id": int, "secondary_group_ids": [int, ...]}
                is still accepted and auto-upgraded to whole-group scopes; the
                server derives and stores both shapes.
                include_master_group_streams (bool, default false, bead
                6xxmp): also match the MASTER group's OWN streams (any
                provider) to the master channels — a whole-group catch-all for
                a same-named cross-provider group (Dispatcharr merges
                same-named groups into one id), usually superseded by adding
                the same group under the other provider as a secondary scope.
                Streams already attached are skipped, so only the unsynced
                provider's streams attach.
                assume_current_date (bool, default false): place a listing
                that carries a time but NO date onto the CURRENT date so
                dateless "today's schedule" feeds become matchable — relaxes
                the never-guess-the-date rail (cross-day match risk).
                parse_master_from_stream (bool, default false): read each
                master channel's event identity (title+time) from its first
                attached stream's name instead of the channel name, so master
                channels can be named freely.
                promote_unmatched (bool, default false, bead ti939.4.1):
                promote unmatched secondary-only events to ECM-managed
                channels in promote_target_group_id (required when enabled;
                must be a dedicated group — never the master or a
                secondary). ECM CREATES those channels and DELETES them via
                orphan reconciliation when the justifying stream leaves the
                provider playlist. max_promote_per_run (int, default 25,
                max 200) caps NEW promoted channels per run. The preview
                reports the plan under "promotion" / "Would promote".
                The built-in parse patterns also accept "|" and "("
                delimiters, weekday prefixes, trailing suffixes after the
                time, and numeric month-first dates ("(7.12 9:15 AM ET)"); a
                Dispatcharr Channel Group Override on the master group is
