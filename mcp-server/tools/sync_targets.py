"""Sync-target CRUD tools (enhancedchannelmanager-jcj0f).

Wraps backend/routers/sync_targets.py — cross-instance live-sync
destinations (a SyncTarget is a remote Dispatcharr/ECM instance this
instance can push config to, epic i39wu). Mirrors the cloud-target CRUD
posture: credentials are Fernet-encrypted at rest and every response masks
them (last-4 chars only) — these tools never decrypt or otherwise echo a
full credential value. There is no sync-target connection-test endpoint on
the backend (unlike cloud-targets) — a live sync run is the only way to
validate reachability; the sync execution engine's SSRF gate runs at that
point (see routers/sync_targets.py module docstring).

enhancedchannelmanager-9kwzp.10 item 3 reviewed the gate on all five
endpoints. They were already admin-gated (``RequireAdminIfEnabled``) and
they stay that way, reads and writes alike. That gate ADMITS the static MCP
service principal, so all five tools here continue to work over MCP.

That is a deliberate PO decision against a human-admin gate for the three
writes, which 9kwzp.10 initially shipped and which returned 403 to
``create_sync_target``, ``update_sync_target`` and ``delete_sync_target``.
The residual it accepts, so a caller knows what these tools can do: writing
a sync target names a remote host, stores the credentials this instance
authenticates to it with, sets ``insecure`` (which turns off TLS
verification for that traffic) and registers the target's ``dbas_sync_<id>``
scheduled task — so an update can silently repoint a push the operator
already configured, and the authoritative SSRF check does not run until
execute time. The caller must still be an admin, and the outbound-policy
write (``PATCH /api/settings/security``) is still refused to this principal.
