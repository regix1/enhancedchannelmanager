        restore WOULD do. Pass ``confirm_apply=True`` only when you intend to
        APPLY the restore, which OVERWRITES current ECM state from the artifact.
        This is destructive and cannot be undone except by restoring another
        backup. Confirm with the operator before applying.

        THE APPLY IS REFUSED FOR THE MCP CREDENTIAL whenever ECM
        authentication is enabled (bead enhancedchannelmanager-9kwzp.10 item
        2); the PREVIEW is not. ``confirm_apply=True`` returns HTTP 403 with
        the body "The MCP service principal cannot APPLY a DBAS restore",

        settings blob wholesale — the outbound base URLs, the notification
        credentials and the outbound-policy mode included — which is the
        field-level gate on POST /api/settings bypassed in one call. That
        reasoning does not reach a run that writes nothing, so this tool
        remains fully usable in its default preview mode. HUMAN PATH for the
        apply: an ECM admin runs it from the UI, Settings > Backup & Restore.

        The upload-based sibling endpoint refuses this credential in BOTH
        modes, because it decodes a caller-supplied artifact before it ever
        reads ``confirm_apply``. There is no MCP tool for it.

        ENCRYPTED ARTIFACTS: a passphrase-encrypted backup (created via
        create_dbas_backup with a passphrase) requires that SAME passphrase here
        to decrypt. Omit ``passphrase`` for a plain/redacted artifact.

        This is the SAVED-file restore path (no file upload over MCP). The
        artifact must already be on the server — list candidates with
        list_saved_backups. The saved file is NOT deleted by the restore.

        """Get entries from the ECM activity journal/audit log.

        ``limit`` is now honored in full via CLIENT-SIDE pagination: the backend
        GET /api/journal clamps ``page_size`` to 200, so this tool loops pages
        (200 rows each, filters threaded through every request) until it has
        ``limit`` rows or the results are exhausted. The old 200-row cap is gone
        — a 752-merge auto-creation run is fully reachable (bd-0hjrk.1).

        Output is COMPACT — one line per row — so a large response does not blow
        the MCP token budget. Each row shows the timestamp, ``category/action``,
        and entity_name; ``channel_id=<entity_id>`` is always included when
        present. For ``merge_stream`` rows (auto-creation merges) it also
        surfaces the added ``stream_id`` (= after.stream_ids - before.stream_ids,
        falling back to parsing the description) plus the ``streams: <before>→
        <after>`` count delta, so an operator can drive the journal →
        bulk_remove_streams recovery path without a second lookup.

        Args:
            limit: Total number of entries to return. Honored via pagination —
                no longer capped at the backend's 200-row page size (default 20).
            category: Filter by category (e.g., 'channels', 'm3u', 'epg',
                'settings', 'auto_creation').
            batch_id: Filter to a single batched operation's rows. For an
                auto-creation run this is the run's execution_id (as a string),
                so an operator recovering from a bad merge can list every
                (channel_id, stream_id) pair the run touched (bd-0emgo.5).
                Also matches the 8-char batch_id from bulk handlers.
            offset: Number of leading (newest-first) rows to skip before
                collecting ``limit`` rows. Lets an operator page through a large
                batch (default 0).
            include_stream_ids: When True, append the full before/after
                stream-id lists per row for a deep audit. Default False keeps the
                output compact (counts only) to protect the token budget.
