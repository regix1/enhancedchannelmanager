"""MCP tools for interactive stream-to-channel dedup operations.

Implements the three tools locked in ADR-008 §D7:

  mcp__ecm__list_pending_channel_merges  — paginated queue reader
  mcp__ecm__accept_channel_merge         — confirms a merge (POST /accept)
  mcp__ecm__dismiss_channel_merge        — rejects a candidate (POST /dismiss)

All tools wrap the /api/channel-merges/* REST surface via the endpoint-
contract registry (_endpoint_contracts.ENDPOINTS).  4xx responses from the
backend are returned as structured {error: {code, message}} envelopes so the
AI agent can self-recover without catching exceptions:

  - accept 404 (stale target): TARGET_NOT_FOUND — agent should call
    dismiss_channel_merge to clean up the stale pending row.
  - accept 409 (invalid state): INVALID_STATE — row already in a terminal
    state; agent should not retry.
  - dismiss 409 (invalid state): INVALID_STATE — same as above.

5xx responses are re-raised (uncatchable upstream error; the agent cannot
recover automatically).

Auth note (ADR-008 §D6): the actor_token_id recorded in the audit journal is
resolved *server-side* from the bearer token the MCP server sends on every
HTTP request (the dedicated projected MCP API key, mapped by the ECM auth
layer to the corresponding User/token DB id).  The MCP tools do not need to
pass actor identity explicitly — it flows through the Authorization header.

        Confirms the dedup decision for the given merge row: adds the stream to
        the candidate channel in Dispatcharr and, when that lands, transitions
        the queue row to 'merged' with a full audit trail entry.

        The merge is idempotent: calling accept on a row that is already merged
        returns the original outcome envelope without error.

        CHECK `dispatcharr_updated` BEFORE reporting the merge as done, and
        CHECK `status` before reporting the row as gone. They are two different
        facts and neither implies the other:

        - `dispatcharr_updated: true`, `status: 'merged'` — applied, and the
          row has left the queue. This is the only "done".
        - `dispatcharr_updated: false`, `status: 'pending'` — the decision was
          recorded and NO upstream write happened, because the stream-name
          lookup matched zero streams, matched several, matched one with no
          usable id, was truncated at its page ceiling so uniqueness could not
          be established, or failed outright. The merge stays in the queue,
          flagged, with `unapplied_reason` saying why in operator-actionable
          terms. Relay that reason rather than reporting success. Once the
          cause clears, retry the same merge_id — that is an ordinary accept,
          not a duplicate decision, and it clears the flag when it lands.
        - `dispatcharr_updated: null`, `status: 'merged'` — an idempotent
          replay of a row that was ALREADY terminal. It performed no
          Dispatcharr call and has no evidence either way. Only a terminal row
          answers null, so this never means "still queued".
