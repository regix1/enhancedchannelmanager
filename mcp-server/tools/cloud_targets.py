"""Cloud-target tools.

The Export tab's playlist-profile / generate / publish tools were removed with
the tab (beads vrrxv / 1w428). ``list_cloud_targets`` remains because cloud
storage targets are still load-bearing for DBAS backup uploads. The backing
endpoint was relocated from ``/api/export/cloud-targets`` to the dedicated
``/api/cloud-targets`` router with the Export tab's removal.

enhancedchannelmanager-jcj0f added create/update/delete/test — the surface was
list-only before. Credentials are Fernet-encrypted at rest on the backend and
every response masks them (last-4 chars only, see
``routers/cloud_targets.py::_mask_credentials``); these tools never decrypt or
otherwise echo a full credential value — they only ever forward what the
caller supplies (to the encrypted-write endpoints) and surface whatever the
backend's already-masked response contains.

enhancedchannelmanager-9kwzp.10 item 4 closed a real gap on this router:
all four CRUD endpoints carried NO route dependency at all, so any
authenticated non-admin could create, change or delete a cloud target.
They are now admin-gated (``RequireAdminIfEnabled``). All four keep the
PLAIN admin tier, which ADMITS the static MCP service principal, so
``list_cloud_targets``, ``create_cloud_target``, ``update_cloud_target``
and ``delete_cloud_target`` all continue to work over MCP.

That was a deliberate PO decision against a human-admin gate for the three
writes, which 9kwzp.10 initially shipped and which returned 403 to all
three tools. The residual it accepts, so a caller knows what these tools
can do: writing a cloud target names the host ``tasks/dbas_backup.py``
PUTs the operator's archive to, supplies the credentials it authenticates
with, and carries the ``insecure`` flag that turns off TLS verification
for that upload — so an update can silently repoint a destination the
operator already configured. The caller must still be an admin, and the
outbound-policy write (``PATCH /api/settings/security``) is still refused
to this principal.

enhancedchannelmanager-9kwzp.6 had already moved BOTH connection-test endpoints
(``POST /api/cloud-targets/{target_id}/test`` and
``POST /api/cloud-targets/test``) behind ``RequireHumanAdminForOutboundTest``,
which refuses the static MCP service principal. Bead
enhancedchannelmanager-2u4e0 additionally makes that gate enforce while
authentication is disabled, on any instance that holds an operator identity.
``test_cloud_target`` therefore cannot succeed over MCP on any install that has
ever created a user; its
docstring records the refusal and the human path. The list/create/update/delete
tools are unaffected.

        and reports the upstream verdict back. In the saved-target mode those
        credentials are the target's own stored ones, decrypted by the backend,
        which the caller never had to know. That is an outbound probe reserved
        for a human operator identity.

        HUMAN PATH: an ECM admin runs it from the UI, Settings tab, Cloud
        Storage Targets card, via the "Test Connection" button on the target
        (or the test control inside the target editor for an unsaved
        credential set). There is no MCP equivalent, and no argument to this
        tool changes the outcome.

        The one case where this tool still works is an install with
