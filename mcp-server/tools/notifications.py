        The backing endpoint, ``GET /api/alert-methods``, carried no route
        dependency at all until bead enhancedchannelmanager-9kwzp.10 item 4,
        which gated it as ADMIN — plain ``RequireAdminIfEnabled``, which
        admits the MCP service principal, so this tool keeps working. That
        bead briefly human-admin-gated the route (403 to this tool); the PO
        reversed it, because the tool is the operator's inventory of their
        own alert methods.

        THE RESPONSE IS MASKED AT THE SOURCE (bead
        enhancedchannelmanager-9kwzp.13). The endpoint used to return each
        method's ``config`` VERBATIM, which handed this principal the Discord
        webhook URL, the Telegram bot token and the SMTP password, the exact
        values bead 9ej7f withholds from it on ``GET /api/settings``. The
        handler now serializes through
        ``models.AlertMethod.to_dict(include_sensitive=False)``, so those keys
        come back as ``********`` and no credential VALUE reaches this tool.

        The response is still operator configuration rather than public data:
        it carries the non-credential config keys, which for Telegram includes
        the destination ``chat_id`` and for SMTP the recipient list. This tool
        prints only the name, id, type, enabled flag and severity filters, and
        deliberately does NOT print ``config``. Keep it that way, and do not
        echo a raw response from this endpoint into a transcript.

        The four write/single-read routes on this router (create, get by id,
        update, delete) DO refuse this principal, and ``test_alert_method``
        has been refused since bead 9kwzp.6. There are no MCP tools for them;
        an ECM admin manages alert methods in the UI, Settings tab, Alert
        Methods section.

        REFUSED FOR THE MCP CREDENTIAL whenever ECM authentication is enabled
        (bead enhancedchannelmanager-9kwzp.6), and since bead
        enhancedchannelmanager-2u4e0 also whenever authentication is DISABLED on
        an instance that already holds an operator identity. The backing endpoint,
        ``POST /api/alert-methods/{method_id}/test``, carries
        ``RequireHumanAdminForOutboundTest``, which rejects the static MCP
        service principal with HTTP 403 and the body "The MCP service
        principal cannot run connection tests." Calling this tool returns that
        403 as an error string. It is the designed outcome, not a
        misconfiguration and not a permission an operator can grant to the MCP
        key: the test sends with the method's STORED credentials (the Discord
        webhook URL, the Telegram bot token, the SMTP password held in
        ``AlertMethod.config``), which the caller never had to know, and
        reports the upstream verdict back, so it is reserved for a human
        operator identity.

        HUMAN PATH: an ECM admin runs it from the UI, Settings tab, Alert
        Methods section, via the "Send test message" button on the method.
        There is no MCP equivalent. ``list_alert_methods`` works, so the
        configured methods remain readable over MCP; only the send is gated.

        The one case where this tool still works is an install with
        authentication turned off, because the gate no-ops when
        ``require_auth`` is false or setup is incomplete. Do not rely on that.
